When I mentioned to an acquaintance that I'd been thinking about J.S. Bach's "Goldberg" variations he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's 1970 recording, which I did. (You can listen to it [here](https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w))

The instrument sounds like a modern revival harpsichord equipped with 16', 4', nasard, buff, which Richter uses in all combinations, often changing registration on the (not always observed) repeats, sometimes changing within phrases. His touch is organistic, his tempi mostly plausible but momentarily uneven, and with little sense of meter or momentum. Color subordinates counterpoint and linear structure: Each variation becomes a _pièce de caractère_. (a _Pièce Richtère_?)

[//]: As I considered how to tactfully tell my friend that I disliked the recording (as you might have guessed from the above description), I got to thinking: what's wrong with Richter anyways?

Needless to say, I found the recording strange. Even more strange was the comments section (O anomic forum, o haven of the disenfranchised!). Like the comments on other Richter recordings, it was full of panegyrics from the sort of armchair critics who wield praise as a token of refinement and discrimination, a mode of musical appreciation which will be familiar to those who claim to have taste, HIP musicians perhaps most of all. 

Rather than brush the recording and its partisans aside, I decided to try to give a reasoned appraisal, and found myself struggling with the resultant questions: How did this all happen? What led Richter to cut this particular record, and how do we explain its continuing appeal?

### Progress

The consensus in my musical circles (the ones that care for Bach, at least) is that romantic performances of Bach (and Richter's is a very late and relatively inoffensive one) are products of an age lacking in essential knowledge about the context of ancient music, and hence lacking in taste and merit. 

I take it as fact that today's esteemed scholar/performers know more about the life and times of JSB than Richter -- some documents had not been brought to light at the time -- but this is an incomplete etiology of Richter's strange disc.

From my historian's armchair, I begin with the assumption that there were social currents which led Richter to make this particular recording at the beginning of the same decade in which CM Wein undertook the first complete period instrument Bach cantata edition, and in which such ensembles as the AoAM, Concerto Vocale and Les Arts Florissants. were founded. I believe that there is much to be learned about the nature of the nascent period-instrument movement by trying to situate Richter in this musical culture of shifting tastes.

Further, if we are to feel that modern (read: HIP) performances of the Goldbergs are more worthy of our praise and attention, we should have more to say on the matter than labeling the old interpretations in "poor taste." Acquiescence to the ineffable _bon gout_ is a pleasant but unproductive, historical reenactment borne out of nostalgia for an irrecoverable (indeed imaginary) time when western musical culture was monolithic and tasteful.

Maybe _de gustibus..._ but what of _de bonis_? 

Even those who take the (neo-platonic?) view that, _ex-ante_, the informed performance is the better one (and I may, at times be counted among them), should conceded that this is a question of aesthetics and recordings, not of virtues and musicians. We do not wish to know whether Richter was _right_ to do any particular thing, rather whether the recording (as it captured Richter's often changing interpretation) is _good_ or _beautiful_ as it presents itself to us, and as we try to understand it on its terms and our own. As musicians know, the well-informed are not always the best performers: the proof must be in the execution, and we cannot close this aesthetic argument with a summary of the player's beliefs and values.

One reason why the quasi-scientific narrative of "learned performance is better performance" bothers me is because it bears a troubling resemblance to the teleological "establishment classical" reading of organology (advanced by a recent CSO pre-concert lecture) that asserts that the orchestral instruments did not fully mature until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By this argument, the broader compasses, dynamic ranges, and (a)tonalities which are easily producible with modern instruments makes then better tools for the job. But, to parody the HIP stance, what is a learned mind but a better tool?

### Tools

In the sense that  both the EM and establishment camps have a teleological argument for their "modern" performance practice. 

Only HIP (pace Butt, Haynes) is a kind of modish modernism that asserts that it has fully integrated all cultures, past and present, freeing itself from the shackles of the institution.

### Reading Richter

But where does that leave Richter? 

Performing on a harpsichord in a style

Perhaps the HIP moment was borne out of a reactionary nostalgia for an irrecoverable moment when western musical culture was monolithic and tasteful. Worse, perhaps it was a commercially successful reactionary movement.

The artist, free from the confines of capital, is a romantic idea. We need only look to the published and dedicated outputs of any working composer/musician of the early modern period for evidence that art-for-pay is as old as pay itself, only the transactors have changed. The dedicatee of the "Brandenburgs" was Margrave. The "dedicatee" of the modern concert performance is the LCD concert-goer who will not to pay to hear more adventurous early-music.

Besides being commercially and musically of fashion among  teleological view of musical/organological.

The fact that HIP has enjoyed such commercial success is no less discomforting. Adorno's critique of HIP as a "culture of restoration" 

not the least bit because of how deeply enmeshed I am in communities of historical performance.
