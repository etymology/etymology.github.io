<p>Some time ago I decided to chart the relationship between various ideas that I’d been having on a scrap of notebook paper, drawing bubbles for conceptual areas or questions (e.g. aesthetics, music performance practice).</p>

<p>The idea was to depict how my scattered interests are connected. The answers to the question “Why am I interested in Arabic calligraphy?” and “Why am I interested in Historically Informed Performance?” are related. Although they appear unrelated, my interest in both is informed by my study of the way that cultures form generating aesthetic priniciples which generate works of art. The cultures are different, the parameters are different, but the processes of taste formation and aesthetic generation universal.</p>

<p>In a sense, what I was looking for are invariants of the soul. I wanted to find the core of my being by understanding the reasons for my interests. I hoped that once I found the core generating principle I would find my life’s pursuit.</p>

<p>I also hoped that the network would help me find new topics to pursue. Like the preference algorithms designed by Spotify or Amazon to target music and product recommendations respectively, perhaps I could stumble upon something new and interesting this way.</p>

<p>Neither of my goals has (yet) been fulfilled by the network, not because I was able to find a single root interest (I did find one) or because the network had disconnected components (it is, in fact, strongly connected) but becuase the conclusions that I reached were unsatisfying, and trivial.</p>
