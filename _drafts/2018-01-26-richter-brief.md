When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called "Goldberg Variations," he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's 1970 recording (which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w)). This recording is quite unlike those that I am most familiar with (e.g. Verlet, Egarr, Gould, Schiff) and a number of its features stood out to me as strange. These thoughts are the result of my attempts to explain the recording and my reactions to it.

Richter's performance is neither Gouldian in its individualist anachronism, nor does it clearly follow what we would call today "historically informed" performance (hence, HIP). Although he plays a harpsichord instead of a piano, his instrument does not resemble those available to Bach at the time and place of composition (ca. 1735-1740, Leipzig), and many of his interpretive choices (tempi, rubato, accents) differ significantly from those made by modern (read: HIP) performances. 

A complete etiology and analysis of Richter's style and his relation to the HIP movement, which was to flourish commercially and artistically in the decade following this recording is a project for another time. Instead, I'll discuss two aspects of the recording which I feel best explain my initial reactions: the instrument used, and the sense of time, or meter.

### On affordances

The harpsichord used in the 1970 recording is a large, loud one. I do not have a source for its make or disposition but I seems to have (in addition to the normal 8' choirs) 16', 4' nasard and buff. Following Williams, Bach's was nation whose "first keyboard-love was the organ, and whose harpsichords were either simple work-horses or elaborate pseudo-organs." Clearly Richter's instrument falls into the latter category, although its disposition is not comparable to any German keyboard instruments from the period of composition, ca. 1735-40.

Perhaps this "pseudo-organ" suits Richter, who was first an organist. The various dispositions supports an interpretation of the variation form in which color subordinates counterpoint and linear structure, and each variation is a _pièce de caractère_. (A _pièce richtère_?)

This interpretation feels foreign to both the music and the instrument. While the organ and the harpsichord are both "binary" keyboard instruments, that is, instruments whose keyboards are essentially non-velocity sensitive,
