I recently volunteered to participate in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition although this is not a stance which I would defend in private.

Why argue for the death penalty? First, because the burden of proof lies upon its supporters. Under the basic principles of liberal democracies (our implicit domain), the use of state power is illegitimate unless it can be credibly shown to achieve a public purpose rightly sought by the system of governance. Officials of the state do not have legal or moral license to wield their powers capriciously or without such prior justification. This is an expression of the moral subordination of a liberal-democratic government to the citizenry which it governs. 

Second, I find most of the

Those defending the death-penalty face an uphill battle.

### Capital punishment today

State use of capital punishment has been in sharp decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, a European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war- and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.

All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.

The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per-se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence.

Thus, in the "developed world," the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate and numerous cases heard at the nation's highest court, which generally affirm that the death penalty is only to be given in cases of the most heinous capital crimes (i.e. homicide). It may not be applied to those who committed their crimes as minors, the insane, minor accomplices, and it may not be a mandatory sentence.

The first exponent of the abolition of the death penalty is traditionally taken to be Beccaria, whose 1790 "on crimes and punishments" proposed a radical reform of European systems of criminal justice founded on the 

The application of the death penalty in states which retain it has been in decline throughout the 20th century. Ma
