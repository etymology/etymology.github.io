        "excerpt":"  (1570s) a practice or trial performance of a play or other work for later public performance.The verb “to rehearse” (13c. “to repeat, give an account of”) comes from Old French “rehercier” (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. “herse” (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across a plowed field to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. The modern sense comes from the late 16th century.Compare also “hirsute” (hairy, spiny) and “hearse” (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a “herse” for its resemblance to farm tool. The term synecdochically came to refer to the coffin and the vehicle.(source)Think of the long trip home.Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?...“Is it lack of imagination that makes us cometo imagined places, not just stay at home?Or could Pascal have been not entirely rightabout just sitting quietly in one’s room?Continent, city, country, society:the choice is never wide and never free.And here, or there ... No. Should we have stayed at home,wherever that may be?”– from Elizabeth Bishop, “Questions of Travel”To a fault, my mental activity is dictated by my environment. I require distinct spaces for sleep, socialization, reflection. I’m probably not alone in this.It recently occurred to me that the spaces most conducive to my creativity are liminal: spaces like the intimate recital hall, convivial dinner table, coffee shop, or reading room, which blend privacy and exposure, familiarity and novelty, in turn fostering a productive balance between contemplation and expression, reduction and synthesis. When these forces are properly balanced, my mind can spin taut conceptual webs. Too much tension and the mental filament tears. Too little and the web is formless, slack.I hope this blog will be a virtual creative space for the elaboration of my thoughts: a place to try out ideas before a forgiving audience, for mental “re-hearsal,” its content somewhere between a transcript of my internal monologue and a polished work.I thank my first and most forgiving audience – my friends – for their sound advice and for engaging me in helpful conversation, even when it was tedious. Although they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, it would not have come to light without their encouragement. My particular thanks go to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure and to Ronen for inspiring me to start.

        "title": "Richter plays BWV 988 v1",
        "excerpt":"When I mentioned to an acquaintance that I’d been thinking about J.S. Bach’s “Goldberg” variations he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording, which I did. (You can listen to it here)The instrument sounds like a modern revival harpsichord equipped with 16’, 4’, nasard, buff, which Richter uses in all combinations, often changing registration on the (not always observed) repeats, sometimes even within phrases. His touch is organistic, his tempi mostly plausible but momentarily uneven, and with little sense of meter or momentum. Color subordinates counterpoint and linear structure. Each variation becomes a pièce de caractère. (A pièce richtère?)Stranger than recording is the comments section (O anomic haven for the disenfranchised!), full of panegyrics (and a few poorly aimed invectives) from armchair critics wielding preference as a token of refinement. “Very serious and not easy-listening” writes one. This practice of virtue-signalling takes on another form “HIP connoisseur” who savors “rare” music as a sign of discrimination.How did have such a high opinion of a recording which would never sell today? Perhaps they, from outside the HIP bubble, heard it in a way that I could not. To give them the benefit of the doubt, I resolved to think more on the question of Richter’s aesthetics.StakesThe recording in question was made at the beginning of the decade which saw the flourishing of CM Wein and the foundation of such groups as the AoAM, Concerto Vocale, and Les Arts Florissants. In short, the success in earnest of the period-instrument/HIP movement. In reevaluating Richter, we are also reevaluating HIP’s ascent, and its aesthetic principles.We begin from the perspective of skepticism: sketicism that theAt least, we must explain why our tastes have changed.ProgressThe consensus in my musical circles (the ones that care for Bach, at least) is that romantic performances of Bach (and Richter’s is a very late and relatively inoffensive one) are products of an age lacking in essential knowledge about the context of ancient music, and hence lacking in essential merit.I take it as fact that today’s esteemed scholar/performers know more about the life and times of JSB than Richter – some documents had not been brought to light at the time – but this fact is not an etiology.Even those performers that who take the (neo-platonic?) view that, ex-ante, the informed performance is the better one should concede that the question of Richter’s popularity (or rejection) is a question of aesthetics and recordings, not of virtues and musicians. We do not, in principle, care whether Richter acted rightly, rather we should care that the recording is good or beautiful, as we experience it, and try to understand it on its terms and our own.As musicians know, the well-informed are not always the best performers: the proof must be in the execution, and we cannot close this aesthetic argument with a summary of the player’s beliefs and values.SuspicionOne reason why the quasi-scientific narrative of “learned performance is better performance” bothers me is because it bears a troubling resemblance to the teleological “establishment classical” reading of organology (advanced by a recent CSO pre-concert lecture) that asserts that the orchestral instruments did not fully mature until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By this argument, the broader compasses, dynamic ranges, and (a)tonalities which are easily producible with modern instruments makes then better tools for the job. But, to parody the HIP stance, what is a learned mind but a better tool?ToolsIn the sense that  both the EM and establishment camps have a teleological argument for their “modern” performance practice.Only HIP (pace Butt, Haynes) is a kind of modish modernism that asserts that it has fully integrated all cultures, past and present, freeing itself from the shackles of the institution.Reading RichterBut where does that leave Richter?Performing on a harpsichord in a stylePerhaps the HIP moment was borne out of a reactionary nostalgia for an irrecoverable moment when western musical culture was monolithic and tasteful. Worse, perhaps it was a commercially successful reactionary movement.The artist, free from the confines of capital, is a romantic idea. We need only look to the published and dedicated outputs of any working composer/musician of the early modern period for evidence that art-for-pay is as old as pay itself, only the transactors have changed. The dedicatee of the “Brandenburgs” was Margrave. The “dedicatee” of the modern concert performance is the LCD concert-goer who will not to pay to hear more adventurous early-music.Besides being commercially and musically of fashion among  teleological view of musical/organological.The fact that HIP has enjoyed such commercial success is no less discomforting.

        "title": "Richter plays BWV 988 v2",
        "excerpt":"When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called “Goldberg Variations,” he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording (which you can hear here)Even before I had listened to the recording, I was deeply skeptical and frankly doubted whether it had any artistic merit at all. In my musical circles (among them HIP musicians and recorder players) romantic interpretions of Bach are generally looked down upon as relics of a time which did not benefit from the wealth of information now readily available on the life and times of JSB, a knowledge which these musicians, paradigmatically, as essential to the tasteful, indeed to the “good” performance of this music.The relationship between scholarship and performance is also unclear. Perhaps, knwoing the biographical facts of the composer’s life, his societal position and the social pressures upon him, will change our performance, but how? And why should we believe that the changes are for the better?We may take it as a fact that knowledge of period performance practice was less widespread in 1970 than now, but this does not account for differences in taste. The subsequent decade would see the flourishing of CM Wein, the foundation of the AoAM, Concerto Vocale and Les Arts Florrissants: clearly HIP was in the air.ImpressionsIs music an activity of the body, or the soul?Richter and SchiffSo here’s some of what I’ve been thinking about, which has been changing and expanding as I write.One question is “How do we prepare for/perform/recognize a good ‘modern’ performance of the Goldberg variations?” With particular reference to recordings in question: Richter, Schiff, and my imaginary “mental ideal HIP” performance (because I can’t find a HIP one that I like enough to use as an example, maybe Rondeau).The question is closely tied to (in the same order as trichotomy of preparation/performance/reception “is music about souls (of musicians), movements, or recordings/sonic experiences?”When HIP musicians ask this question, preparation (foreknowledge of the work, its circumstances, its place in relation trends in music history and composition) is paramount to the performance, but this is a concern for performers, not for critics. As listeners to the music, we must be primarily concerned with the actual movements and sounds, not as much with the knowledge/beliefs of the performer. We should try to connect prepartion to performance (the movements) and the sound experience in order to justify different kinds of preparation on listener aesthetic grounds.I wish to argue that the critical thing that makes Early Music/HIP special is that it prioritizes music as an action physically enacted by bodies, and rather than seeing the physical laws of motion that govern performance as limitations, it takes them to be principles essential to the composition of the works, and essential to their performance. Dance, the way that modies move through space, weight of the hands on keys/bows, momentum, velocity. This is a philosophy based primarily on performance. Here, the music is maybe like a transcript of motions.Richter, on the other hand, prioritizes the soul, artistic inspiration over the mechanics of performance or the actual end result (he is said to have been pleased that his interpretations frequently changed). This is an essentially romantic concept of the music: the composer (and by extension, the performer) as an inspired genius channelling the ineffable. Here, music is like a platonic form or pure concept.The modern post-industrial/mechanistic paradigm might by summarized as being about outcomes. What matters is consistency in the actual production of the sound, range of sounds possible to be produced. This is a philosophy of music focused on sonic outcomes. Here, music is like a sonic experience or sound recording.Using this trichotomy, inqiure about Richter’s practice: in what ways does its practice fail to take into account certain factors which led to the composition of the work? One critical way: meter, physics, dance, movement of bodies is removed from the picture. Counterpoint too, as a simulation of many individual instruments, is muddied. This generates many of the things I find “unpleasant” about it.Schiff, on the other hand has a strong sense of meter and counterpoint, but perhaps comes out a bit “bland” in terms of performance (the movements) in being conventionally regulated in the manner of Modern Classical post-mechanistic play.Another way in which they differ is in their use of the affordances of their instrument: Richter uses few of the affordances of the harpsichord, well the only one really: note length. On the other hand, Schiff makes use of the piano color in a useful way. This also gets at the reasons why we should play on period instruments in the first place: partly it is because of the sound that they produce, but also the way in whcih the feeling of the instrument informs the play style. If, as in Richter’s case, the instrument only vaguely approximates the feelings of play and the sound, why should we think it a better instrument than, say, the hammered dulcimer, the modern piano or the (anachronistic) unfretted clavichord?So which is the better “modern” performance: I argue Schiff. For his clearer projection of the physicality of the music, use of an instrument whose affordances are used to the fullest. In the ideal HIP recording, we could use a sound informed more by the feeling of play, and by physicality, the aspects of performance most critical to the interpretation.","categories": ["music","aesthetics"],

        "title": "Towards an aesthetics of food",
        "excerpt":"I’ve been on the hunt for quality discussions of food aesthetics. Unfortunately, I have found few interesting texts on the topic. (perhaps Nicola Perullo’s “Taste as Experience,” though my survey is obviously incomplete; please advise) Most books on the “philosophy of food” (e.g. the eponymous collection ed. Kaplan) focus on questions surrounding the production and social context of food. For example, the ethical/environmental concerns surrounding mass agriculture, food transportation, and animal husbandry. Or the ways in which our consumption of food expresses social class, cultural heritage, or values.But these are not the questions which concern me every day as eater and chef. I wish to know about the essential parameters of the eating experience, to answer questions such as: What is good food? How is it made? I use the adjective “good” here in the common way of talking about “good art” or “good music.” That I choose not to restrict myself to the more specific qualities of “tastiness” or “beauty” or “ethicality” reflects my broad and interdisciplinary view of eating.Indeed, food’s quotidian nature surely contributed to its near total neglect by those interested in art and beauty. Plato regarded food as a utility to be properly regulated by medicine, a science rather than an art. Most home cooks do not regard themselves as artists.But cookery, like speech or movement, can be practiced at many levels, and just as everyday speech and movement carry aesthetic qualities, so does everyday food. Its ubiquity should not discredit its aesthetic potential. It is clear from the elevated food cultures that exist around the world that food is a primary domain of the exertion of taste, as primal as sounds or images. Fine food has all the qualities of an aesthetic experience: it’s preparation may be creative, inspired, practiced, perfected, meaningful, its consumption savored, compared, criticized.If any doubt remains that the gustatory experience is worthy of the same serious investigation as the experience of the fine arts, we need only recall that “taste,” that much-maligned sense associated with eating over any other activity, is synonymous with the faculty of aesthetic distinction. I believe that this is no coincidence. Just as the first aesthetic preferences that we express as children are likely to be about food, so gustatory experience may be the starting point for a discussion of a comprehensive aesthetics which extends beyond the fine arts to encompass a broad range of experiences of discrimination.The end of this enterprise is not solely descriptive either. Armed with and informed by a clear understanding of the aesthetic dimensions of food, we may creatively extend them. That is, we may use our understanding of the principles of degustation to create new “oeuvres de cuisine” which surprise and delight the palate and all the other senses. This seems a noble goal indeed.The dimensions of food","categories": ["food"],

        "title": "Novel arguments for the death penalty",
        "excerpt":"I recently volunteered to participate in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition although this is not a stance which I would defend in private.Why argue for the death penalty if I don’t support it myself? First, because the burden of proof in the debate lies upon its supporters. Under the basic principles of liberal democracies (our implicit domain), the use of state power is illegitimate unless it can be credibly shown to achieve a public good rightly sought by the government. Officials of the state do not have legal or moral license to wield their powers capriciously or without such prior justification. This is an expression of the moral subordination of a liberal-democratic government to the citizenry which it governs.Thus, opponents to the death penalty need only instill doubt that the death penalty achieves a legitimate public good in order to call for its abolishment. As defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, the death penalty should be presumed unjust until proven otherwise, in particular due to the extreme severity of the sentence in relation to other sanctions, such as life imprisonment.Second, I find most of the common arguments for the death penalty to be weak. Some, like the closure and retribution arguments (which respectively argue that only execution can bring solace to the bereaved and that only death is proporitional punishment for capital crimes) fail to show that the death penalty is a necessary punishment when the leading alternative, life imprisonment, allows for later exoneration of the wrongfully convicted. This is just one respect in which capital punishment is fundamentally different from “lesser” sanctions. This is a challenge for those who would place it at a continuum of punishments of varying severity a la Beccaria.Others, like the deterrence argument (which draws its justification from the potential crimes prevented by the threat of execution) succeed or fail on empirical bases: a proponent of this argument must argue that a deterrent effect actually exists. Such empirical claims are difficult to substantiate and are of little interest to me.In light of these shortcomings, it seems to me that an effective argument for the the death penalty should not rely on empirical claims and should treat the death penalty uniquely, as opposed to as part of a spectrum of sanctions. Only an argument of this variety could stand against the overwhelming presumption for abolition.Capital punishment todayState use of capital punishment has been in decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, a European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war- and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per-se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence.Thus, in the “developed world,” the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate and numerous cases heard at the nation’s highest court, which generally affirm that the death penalty is only to be given in cases of the most heinous capital crimes (i.e. homicide). It may not be applied to those who committed their crimes as minors, the insane, minor accomplices, and it may not be a mandatory sentence.The first exponent of the abolition of the death penalty is traditionally taken to be Beccaria, whose 1790 “on crimes and punishments” proposed a radical reform of European systems of criminal justice founded on theThe application of the death penalty in states which retain it has been in decline throughout the 20th century.

Here is a partial attempt to explain the recording and my reactions to it.Richter’s performance izz. Although he plays a harpsichord instead of a piano, his instrument does not resemble those available to Bach at the time and place of composition (ca. 1735-1740, Leipzig), and many of his interpretive choices (tempi, rubato, accents) differ significantly from those made by modern HIP performances.A complete etiology and analysis of Richter’s style and his relation to the HIP movement, which flourished commercially and artistically in the decade following this recording, is a project for another time. Instead, I’ll discuss two aspects of the recording which I feel best explain my initial reactions: the instrument used, and the sense of time, or meter.On affordancesThe harpsichord is large and loud. I do not have a source for its make or disposition but I seems to have (in addition to the normal 8’ choirs) 16’, 4’ nasard and buff. Following Williams, Bach’s was nation whose “first keyboard-love was the organ, and whose harpsichords were either simple work-horses or elaborate pseudo-organs.” Clearly Richter’s instrument falls into the latter category, although its disposition is not comparable to any German keyboard instruments from the period of composition, ca. 1735-40.It is altogether fitting to call Richter’s instrument a “psuedo-organ” because Richter was an organist, and plays like one. While he use stheAlthough this “pseudo-organ” suits Richter, first an organist, Richter’s use of disposition to creat color contrasts feels foreign to the contrapunctal writing of the Goldbergs. While he makes use of the registrational possibilities, Richter’s touch is heavy and insensitive.I believe that this is more than simply a difference of taste: it is also a matter of the most effective use of the instrument’s affordances.

I have fond memories of the film. Maybe it was because, like the protagonistic sisters Satsuki and Mei, I spent many a summer afternoon playing outside in the garden or at the marshy border of my elementary school’s play-yard, hoping to catch a glimpse the magical realm of Totoro, or at least a rabbit or two.On Saturday evening (1/27) I went to see the film at UChicago’s student-run film society, Doc Films. Totoro is lighter fare than most Doc screenings, and the theater was crowded.Watching Totoro with adult eyes, after a hiatus of at least five years, I grew nostalgic, but also confused. At moments when I was holding back tears, first time viewers (or so I presume) were laughing.
