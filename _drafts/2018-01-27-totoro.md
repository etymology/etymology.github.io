This year marks the 30th anniversary of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's "My Neighbor Totoro," the film which introduced me to Ghibli, and to Japanese animation, as a child. I have fond memories of the film. Maybe it was because, like the protagonistic sisters Satsuki and Mei, I spent many a summer afternoon playing outside in the garden or at the marshy border of my elementary school's play-yard, hoping to catch a glimpse the magical realm of Totoro, or at least a rabbit or two. 

On Saturday evening (1/27) I went to see the film at UChicago's student-run film society, Doc Films. Totoro is lighter fare than most Doc screenings, and the theater was crowded.

Watching Totoro with adult eyes, after a hiatus of at least five years, I grew nostalgic, but also confused. At moments when I was holding back tears, first time viewers (or so I presume) were laughing. Beyond the fact of my sadness, this incogruity confirmed to me an even greater loss: the impossibility of watching the film with the eyes of a child, or even those of a first time viewer. That it was not the film but my eyes that had changed in those intervening years. The film of my childhood was somehow lost. 

### "Let's laugh to keep ghosts away"

The lushly animated Japanese countryside, drenched in a high summer sun, a country road (which will feature later on as the way in and out of the world where most of the film's action takes place) draw the viewer in.

We find the Kusakabe family (Satsuki, Mei, and father Tatsuo) in transit. We aren't told why, but it will later become apparent that they are relocating to a countryside house closer to the hospital where their mother is convalescing, although this house is far from the university where the father teaches.

But these tensions are suppressed, to be revealed in glances. For now, we see a grinning father and two daughters full of childish energy. Only on this viewing, the  Laughter and imagination are to be the tools with which all three of them cope with the move, the mother's illness, and the challenges which are to face the girls as they grow into adulthood.

The rickety lorry that carries the family's belongings to their new home transports 

that the idyllic sun-drenched Japanese country side could not heal.
