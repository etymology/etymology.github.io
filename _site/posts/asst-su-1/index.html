<p>(the first of two posts, in which I describe my fellow debaters’ arguments and respond to them)</p>

<p>I recently spoke in a debate on the motion “people have a right to die,” arguing that people have a right to die, along with a collection of other moral and political views. I don’t think that I sufficiently addressed the other debaters’ arguments, and I feel that my view was incoherent. Indeed, it was largely improvised. So I wish to try again, summarizing the arguments of the other debaters and formulating a more coherent view here.</p>

<p>This was a debate on the morality of assisted suicide and other forms of “euthanasia” and the proper regulation of them. While we may try to answer moral and political questions in the language of rights, that language is not any more fundamental to their nature than, say, the language of duties.</p>

<p>I believe that the “right to die” is a euphemism, not a deep metaphysical truth whose resolution will reveal something of what is right and good. We should care about whether we act rightly, and whether society is organized in the best possible way. So I will address those questions without presuming the language of rights.</p>

<p>The two speakers who argued that people don’t/shouldn’t have a right to die presented a single coherent view so I’ll address their arguments together. My partner and I had differing views so I describe his separately. I don’t have a recording of the debate, but I have tried to represent all arguments to the best of my memory, and with the greatest charity. I will respond to these arguments with my own, revised, arguments.</p>

<h3 id="against-a-right-to-die-students-for-life">Against a right to die: Students for Life</h3>

<p>Is it wrong to commit suicide? On this, the anti-legalization side conceded that an argument for the immorality of suicide might require the existence of a higher power.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they argued that legal acknowledgment of a “right to die” shows a lack of appreciation for the value of human life. Suppose that we have legally recognized a “right to die.” Consider the following line of reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice is suffering. Perhaps she is terminally ill. She reasons “I am no longer useful. My life is not worth living as it adds nothing to the collective good. In fact, I am a drain on society. So it would be better that I end my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Societal recognition (de facto or de jure legalization, constitutional enshrinement of such a right e.g.) of assisted suicide helped to legitimize Alice’s reasoning. Such reasoning, they argue, displays a fundamental lack of appreciation for human life, both on Alice’s part and the part of the lawmakers. This kind of reasoning treats human life as a mere means to collective good, rather than as an end in itself. No one would like to live in such a society. We should value all human life, and instead Alice to end her own life, we should try to relieve her suffering.</p>

<p>Additionally, they cast doubt on the idea that Alice’s suicide can be rational. Although the future seems bleak, she does not know what her future holds, so how does she know that death will be better than the alternative? They contended that in the the face of such doubt, society should try to alleviate her suffering rather than encouraging her to take her own life.</p>

<p>The two members of SfL also raised practical concerns about the regulation of assisted suicide in practice, citing a case in the Netherlands where a woman with Alzheimer’s who had consented to being euthanized when her “mind was gone” had to be restrained in order to deliver a lethal injection.</p>

<p>Another case is that of a patient in a persistent vegetative state who is disconnected from life support by his family members or doctors. Such a case is sometimes called “letting die” as opposed to “killing.” They asserted that letting die is morally different from physician assisted suicide but did not specify how.</p>

<h3 id="for-a-right-to-die-my-partner">For a right to die: My partner</h3>

<p>My partner’s view paid homage to Locke and Mill. We own our bodies (cf. Locke) and thus may dispose of them as we please, as we would our other possessions, as long as we don’t harm others in the process (cf. Mill). Suicide (destruction of the body) is a direct result of our self-ownership. (n.b. Locke did not support suicide, as he believed that )</p>

<p>He emphasized that assisted suicide is not really a choice to die, as we will all die some day. It is most accurately described as a matter of deciding <em>when</em> to die. If we are utilitarians or egoistic hedonists we may believe that, in the face of sure and intense suffering, we may prefer not to live at all. Furthermore, if we are universal utilitarians, we may believe that the ending of these people’s lives would be better for everyone, so long as they die by their own volition.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-disagree">How do we disagree?</h3>

<p>Both of the views I have just described are incomplete, as would be any view on this complex issue as articulated in a ten minute speech. While my summary doesn’t do them justice, even under the most charitable completions, both views must This is what makes the issue of assisted suicide so fruitful.</p>

<p>I think that the disagreement between these largely consists in differing understanding of the nature of the entities at hand: the state, the person, and rights (for rights are things, albeit metaphysical). Thus, my response must discuss the necessary properties of those entities under each view, examining the consequences, and presenting a more accurate view.</p>

<p>In addition, to the structural problems which all points of view faced, the debate did not consider important practical problems like the moral relevance of the participation of another party in a suicide, the moral significance of intention and the nature of persons. I hope to say something on these matters.</p>

<h4 id="rights">Rights</h4>

<p>As I reiterated during the debate, I feel that it is misleading to frame the issue of assisted suicide with the concept of the framing of “rights.” Without explicit recognition, each side used a different idea of rights. Rather than try to resolve this difference in favor of any single view, I believe that we should set aside the concept altogether.</p>

<p>Rights give us duties and responsibilities. Property rights, for example, invoke a bundle of duties imposed upon others regarding what they may do to another’s property. You may not, without my permission, use, destroy, modify etc. my property. But these rights may be overridden. Suppose that I use my car to block your driveway. By using my car to hinder your legitimate use of your driveway, I forfeit some of the rights which I have over my car in other spaces.</p>

<p>Some people believe that there are rights which may not be overridden, such as the right to life. Perhaps such rights exist but the right to life is regularly forfeited, and is thus not among them. For example, if I attack you it is reasonable to suppose that you might act in self defense and harm or kill me. Criminals, enemy combatants, casualties of war may all be legitimately killed by the state.</p>

<p>What matters in all of these cases is not rights <em>qua</em> rights, but rather the obligations that rights entail. The system of rights proposes that there is a property invariant among people (rights) that entails certain duties, and such a system is only as good as it correctly describes and explains the duties that we have towards one another and to ourselves.</p>

<p>But as we have seen above, the system of rights hardly provides the invariant we are looking for. While they do capture an aspect of common-sense belief about what is right and wrong, their explanatory power is weakened because they are not truly invariant. A system with many exceptions is not systemic, unless the exceptions them are systematic. And if the exceptions are systematic, we should try to understand why.</p>

<p>Rather we should directly ask about reasons, beliefs and facts without presuming that the framework of rights is the best reductive explanatory line of inquiry.</p>

<p>Regarding assisted suicide, we should try to answer the following questions:</p>

<p>Moral questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill oneself?</li>
  <li>When is it rational to kill oneself?</li>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill a person with their ongoing consent?</li>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill an incompetent person with their prior consent?</li>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill an person with their consent?</li>
</ul>

<p>Political questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When should suicide be legal?</li>
  <li>When should assisted suicide be legal?</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the views summarized above fail to satisfactorily address some or all of the questions above, or fail for structural reasons.</p>

<h3 id="against-sfl-defeasing-the-norm-argument">Against SfL: Defeasing the “Norm” Argument</h3>

<p>(this form of argument is due to Brennan and Jaworski)</p>

<p>Suppose that we grant that rights (at least in some limited sense) societal norms that indicate values that we legally uphold and reflect societal attitudes. SfL concluded that acknowledging a right to assisted suicide shows a disregard for human life, and because no person would want to live in a society that disregarded human life, we should not legally acknowledge such a right.</p>

<p>Setting aside for a moment whether legal acknowledgement of assisted suicide does in fact display a regard for humanity, we can question whether it is necessarily so. If it is not necessarily so, perhaps it would be better if we had some other disposition towards assisted suicide. Consider the following example (based on the Fore people of Papua New Guinea)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fore people believed that the proper way to show respect for their dead was to eat their brains. They said “Burying and burning are for garbage! Interring or cremating our dead treats them like garbage. We should treasure their souls by eating their brains.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But they learned that cannibalism (especially of brains) transmits the incurable neurodegenerative disease called Kuru, killing hundreds every year. So they changed their customs. Some were at first uncomfortable with the idea of burying their dead, but they found it acceptable if it alleviated the suffering caused by the Kuru disease. Over time their customs changed, and now suffers slow mental decline and death from Kuru.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the example of the Fore illustrates, societal attitudes about the meanings of our actions are contingent. Acknowledging assisted suicide human life does not <em>necessarily</em> disregard human life, just as cannibalism was not necessary to show respect for the dead. Societal norms have often been revised in our own society. Take moral attitudes about the moral significance of race, or gender.</p>

<p>Just as the suffering from Kuru justified a changed in the Fore people’s values and funerary practices, perhaps intense suffering in the end of life justifies a change in our societal attitudes towards assisted suicide. We should take this concern to heart, and remember that our attitudes are not fixed, and should be changed if we discover other morally significant facts.</p>

<p>Perhaps our situation is like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believed that the proper way to show respect for the terminally ill was to never kill, even with consent. We said “Killings like those are for criminals and animals, not for innocent people. We should respect the dignity of their lives and allow them to die.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But when we came to a more clear understanding of the nature of people, we realized that we could humanely achieve these people’s wishes and alleviate their suffering at the same time. Some people uncomfortable with the idea at first, but they found it acceptable if it alleviated suffering for the terminally ill. Over time customs changed, and now the terminally ill need not suffer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While living in a society which recognizes assisted suicide might make us uncomfortable today, this does not mean that we cannot and should not try to change our attitudes towards the idea. The Fore changed their minds once they learned of the morally significant matters at stake. We may do the same.</p>

<p>Thus, the norm argument can be defensibly denied. It remains an open question whether assisted suicide would in fact provide societal benefits, a situation which is not as clear as the causation of cannibalism and Kuru. But it is clear that our attitude towards assisted suicide are not what matters. We should be open to changing our attitude just as the Fore people changed their attitude towards cannibalism. We should view this change with hope and optimism.</p>

<h4 id="assisted-suicide-and-the-semiotics-of-utilitarianism">Assisted Suicide and the Semiotics of Utilitarianism</h4>

<p>Although I believe that we have reason to doubt the norm argument after discussing circumstances that can mitigate against it, we have seen that its proper functioning depends on the premise “those who advocate for assisted suicide necessarily lack respect or concern for human life.”</p>

<p>SfL argued more specifically that “those who advocate for assisted suicide on utilitarian grounds necessarily lack respect or concern for human life.”</p>

<p>I will not deny this, but</p>

<p>I wish to briefly consider whether it assisting suicide or committing suicide necessarily reveals something morally significant about our disposition.</p>

<p>For those who would argue using the norm argument it is not enough that, in fact, all those who favor assisted suicide don’t sufficiently value human life. They must also demonstrate that it is necessarily so.</p>

<h4 id="against-my-partner-personal-autonomy-and-utilitarianism">Against my partner: Personal Autonomy and Utilitarianism</h4>

<p>My partner, arguing for the right to die, drew both on self-determination and utilitarianism to justify assisted suicide. But I believe that these two ideas are in conflict with each other. We may not be true utilitarians and also hold a Lockean view of total self-ownership.</p>

<p>Suppose that we hold that people may do whatever they please with their bodies and property, the right which also legitimizes suicide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love smoked ham, so I build a smoker in my backyard. But the smoke wafts over the boundaries of my property, mildly annoying my neighbors. But when my neighbors too buy smokers, the smog is significant and unbearable for all, although the effect of each smoker is insignificant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such classic cases of externalities, where the addition of each smoker harms no one in particular but the sum harms a great many people significantly, place autonomy and utilitarianism in conflict. Utilitarianism is impersonal. Utilitarians argue that each person is entitled to the benefits of an action. It does not matter <em>to whom</em> an action befalls so much as how much the total utility is affected by the action. Objection to the impersonality principle has formed the basis of objections as varied as Rawls and Nozick.</p>

<h4 id="rationality-of-suicide">Rationality of suicide</h4>

<p>All parties of the debate considered the question of whether suicide can be rational. This matters because irrationality is often used as justification for paternalism. If we are paternalists with regard to irrationality, we should act to prevent people from committing irrational suicides.</p>

<p>So independent of the justification of paternalism, we may wish to argue for suicide’s rationality/irrational.</p>

<h4 id="utility-and-human-dignity">Utility and human dignity</h4>

<p>SfL also argued that utilitarianism treats people as mere means. When people are no longer useful to society, they should be killed or kill themselves. I believe that this version of utilitarianism is too easy a target. We can simply revise our utility function to include preference satisfaction.</p>

<p>Utility as preference satisfaction suffers from well known problems such as the “utility monster,” a person who derives immense utility from killing others, such that the utility reaped by doing so outweighs any negative effects on his victims and their families.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Alice’s beliefs were incorrect, but she did not act irrationally according to those beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bob encounters the same snake in the desert. He believes that 1b) If I move, the snake will bite me and I will die and 2b) I want to die, so he starts to run away. The snake bites him, and he dies.</p>
