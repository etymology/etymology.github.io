In the introduction to _On What Matters: Volume One_ (2011) Derek Parfit, in typically self-effacing British style, proposes that the goal of his moral philosophy is progress. Unlike modern poets, who have no advantage over Shakespeare or Homer, he writes, modern philosophers have a slight advantage over their ancient counterparts because we have more philosophers to build off of. By standing on the shoulders of giants, we may make progress.
