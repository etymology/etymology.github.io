<p>On 3/2 I attended a colloqium with Agnes Callard (assoc. prof. of phil. at UChicago, author “Aspiration: The Agency of Becoming” (2017, OUP)) discussing an argument about a theory of valuing which she called the “hybrid theory of valuing.”</p>

<p>On this theory of valuing, full fledged valuing involves</p>

<ol>
  <li>Belief that the thing is valuable</li>
  <li>Desire for the thing</li>
  <li>Emotional vulnerability towards a thing</li>
</ol>

<p>To see why the second condition is necessary, we might consider that someone can believe that classical music is valuable while not valuing it personally. The third condition was not discussed. According to Callard, theories of this sort are commonly accepted by those in the field.</p>

<p>In conflict with this kind of valuing are situations of “value breakdown”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Case 1: My father dies. I still value him, a fact evinced by my grief. But I fail to meet the desire requirement because I cannot desire what is impossible: I cannot desire to bring about his presence.</li>
  <li>Case 2: As a student, I strongly valued having a career in philosophy, but when I realize that there are no jobs in my AOS, I am crushed. My emotional response signals that I have a kind of value for the thing, but like how I cannot desire a dead relative, I cannot desire what I believe to be impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Callard then suggested the following exploratory line of argument.</p>

<p>In these cases, valuing is in some way defective, for our valuing of the thing in question leads us to experience mental injury. These kinds of mental injury have all the characterstics of mental illness, but they are caused by normal everyday occurrences. So we are forced to suppose that all negative emotions (or at least a large part of them) are mental illness.</p>

<p>Callard seemed to think that most would be reluctant to accept such a conclusion. I am not. It seems to me that mental illness are matters degree, not of kind. While neurotic or irrational thoughts are the characteristic of mental illnesses, they are present in all minds. We all need some fear, for example fear of being hit by cars when hit when crossing the street, in order to go on living. When these fears are overwhelming and not in accordance with the real threats, perhaps we are deeply afraid of being injured even when sitting at home alone, we call this a mental illness.</p>

<h3 id="is-value-breakdown-defective">Is value-breakdown defective?</h3>

<p>One way in which we can break the aforementioned line of reasoning is to argue that the kind of valuing in Cases 1 and 2 are not full fledged valuing. I believe that this is not necessary. In Case 1, I believe that what we mean when we say that we value</p>
