(This post is one of a series on the death penalty. You can find the others [here](/categories/#death-penalty))

Let us take the basic question to be "When is it just for a state to sentence and individual to death?"

To clarify grounds, we are talking about
- state killing (not killings by vigilantes) 
- under the deliberative rule of a criminal justice system (not extrajudcial killings by police or in wartime)

Some associated questions may be
- What does it mean to kill?
- What differentiates state killings from other killings?
- Who can the state justly kill and on what grounds?

In practice, the processes for the implementation of the death penalty vary, but states typically apply it to those who have committed (or are strongly believed to have committed) heinous crimes, often capital (that is, crimes involving the death of another human being).

With this in mind, we should set capital punishment in an account, both descriptive and normative, of how and when the state "kills"
