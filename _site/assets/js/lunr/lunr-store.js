        "excerpt":"  (1570s) a practice or trial performance of a play or other work for later public performance.The verb “to rehearse” (13c. “to repeat, give an account of”) comes from Old French “rehercier” (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. “herse” (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across a plowed field to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. The modern sense comes from the late 16th century.Compare also “hirsute” (hairy, spiny) and “hearse” (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a “herse” for its resemblance to farm tool. The term synecdochically came to refer to the coffin and the vehicle.(source)Think of the long trip home.Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?...“Is it lack of imagination that makes us cometo imagined places, not just stay at home?Or could Pascal have been not entirely rightabout just sitting quietly in one’s room?Continent, city, country, society:the choice is never wide and never free.And here, or there ... No. Should we have stayed at home,wherever that may be?”– from Elizabeth Bishop, “Questions of Travel”To a fault, my mental activity is dictated by my environment. I require distinct spaces for sleep, socialization, reflection. I’m probably not alone in this.It recently occurred to me that the spaces most conducive to my creativity are liminal: spaces like the intimate recital hall, convivial dinner table, coffee shop, or reading room, which blend privacy and exposure, familiarity and novelty, in turn fostering a productive balance between contemplation and expression, reduction and synthesis. When these forces are properly balanced, my mind can spin taut conceptual webs. Too much tension and the mental filament tears. Too little and the web is formless, slack.I hope this blog will be a virtual creative space for the elaboration of my thoughts: a place to try out ideas before a forgiving audience, for mental “re-hearsal,” its content somewhere between a transcript of my internal monologue and a polished work.I thank my first and most forgiving audience – my friends – for their sound advice and for engaging me in helpful conversation, even when it was tedious. Although they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, it would not have come to light without their encouragement. My particular thanks go to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure and to Ronen for inspiring me to start.

        "title": "Towards an aesthetics of food",
        "excerpt":"I’ve been on the hunt for quality discussions of food aesthetics. Unfortunately, I have found few interesting texts on the topic. (perhaps Nicola Perullo’s “Taste as Experience,” though my survey is obviously incomplete; please advise) Most books on the “philosophy of food” (e.g. the eponymous collection ed. Kaplan) focus on questions surrounding the production and social context of food. For example, the ethical/environmental concerns surrounding mass agriculture, food transportation, and animal husbandry. Or the ways in which our consumption of food expresses social class, cultural heritage, or values.But these are not the questions which concern me every day as eater and chef. I wish to know about the essential parameters of the eating experience, to answer questions such as: What is good food? How is it made? I use the adjective “good” here in the common way of talking about “good art” or “good music.” That I choose not to restrict myself to the more specific qualities of “tastiness” or “beauty” or “ethicality” reflects my broad and interdisciplinary view of eating.Indeed, food’s quotidian nature surely contributed to its near total neglect by those interested in art and beauty. Plato regarded food as a utility to be properly regulated by medicine, a science rather than an art. Most home cooks do not regard themselves as artists.But cookery, like speech or movement, can be practiced at many levels, and just as everyday speech and movement carry aesthetic qualities, so does everyday food. Its ubiquity should not discredit its aesthetic potential. It is clear from the elevated food cultures that exist around the world that food is a primary domain of the exertion of taste, as primal as sounds or images. Fine food has all the qualities of an aesthetic experience: it’s preparation may be creative, inspired, practiced, perfected, meaningful, its consumption savored, compared, criticized.If any doubt remains that the gustatory experience is worthy of the same serious investigation as the experience of the fine arts, we need only recall that “taste,” that much-maligned sense associated with eating over any other activity, is synonymous with the faculty of aesthetic distinction. I believe that this is no coincidence. Just as the first aesthetic preferences that we express as children are likely to be about food, so gustatory experience may be the starting point for a discussion of a comprehensive aesthetics which extends beyond the fine arts to encompass a broad range of experiences of discrimination.The end of this enterprise is not solely descriptive either. Armed with and informed by a clear understanding of the aesthetic dimensions of food, we may creatively extend them. That is, we may use our understanding of the principles of degustation to create new “oeuvres de cuisine” which surprise and delight the palate and all the other senses. This seems a noble goal indeed.The dimensions of food","categories": ["food"],

        "title": "Novel arguments for the death penalty",
        "excerpt":"I recently volunteered to participate in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition although this is not a stance which I would defend in private.The state of debateWhy argue for the death penalty if I don’t support it myself? First, because the burden of proof lies upon its supporters. Under the basic principles of liberal democracies (our implicit domain), the use of state power is illegitimate unless it can be credibly shown to achieve a public good rightly sought by the government. Officials of the state do not have legal or moral license to wield their powers capriciously or without such prior justification. This is an expression of the moral subordination of a liberal-democratic government to the citizenry which it governs.Thus, opponents to the death penalty need only instill doubt that the death penalty achieves a legitimate public good in order to call for its abolishment. Just as defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, the death penalty should be presumed unjust until proven otherwise, in particular due to the extreme severity of the sentence in relation to other sanctions, such as life imprisonment.Second, most of the common arguments for the death penalty are weak. Some, like the closure and retribution arguments (which respectively argue that only execution can bring solace to the bereaved and that only death is proporitional punishment for capital crimes) fail to show that the death penalty is a necessary punishment when the leading alternative, life imprisonment, allows for later exoneration of the wrongfully convicted. This is just one respect in which capital punishment is fundamentally different from “lesser” sanctions. This is a challenge for those who would place it at a continuum of punishments of varying severity a la Beccaria.Others, like the deterrence argument (which draws its justification from the potential crimes prevented by the threat of execution) succeed or fail on empirical bases: a proponent of this argument must argue that a deterrent effect actually exists. Such empirical claims are difficult to substantiate and are of little interest to me.In light of these shortcomings, it seems to me that an effective argument for the the death penalty should not rely on empirical claims and should treat the death penalty uniquely, as opposed to as part of a spectrum of sanctions. Only an argument of this variety could stand against the overwhelming presumption for abolition.Capital punishment todayState use of capital punishment has been in decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, a European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war- and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per-se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence and increased in subsequent years.Thus, in the “developed world,” the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate and numerous cases heard at the nation’s highest court, which generally affirm that the death penalty is only to be given in cases of the most heinous capital crimes (i.e. homicide). It may not be applied to those who committed their crimes as minors, the insane, minor accomplices, and it may not be a mandatory sentence.The first exponent of the abolition of the death penalty is traditionally taken to be Beccaria, whose 1790 “on crimes and punishments” proposed a radical reform of European systems of criminal justice founded on theThe application of the death penalty in states which retain it has been in decline throughout the 20th century.

        "title": "Review: \"Totoro\" still moves me",
        "excerpt":"On Saturday evening (1/27) I went to see “My Neighbor Totoro” at UChicago’s student-run film society, Doc Films, in a special 30th anniversary screening.Totoro was my introduction to Japanese animation and I remember it fondly. Like the protagonistic sisters Satsuki and Mei, I spent summer days in the garden or the forests on the margin of the playground, hoping to catch a glimpse of Totoro or at least a rabbit or two.Watching Totoro on a large screen made me nostalgic but confused. While I was holding back tears, first time viewers (or so I presume) were laughing around me. The incongruity confirmed to me that my eyes had changed, and the film which I had loved a child was lost.(The following review contains spoilers)ResponsibilitiesThe Kusakabe family (daughters Satsuki and Mei; father Tatsuo) has packed their life into an improbably laden jalopy which rattles through the Japanese countryside. We later learn that they are moving to be closer to the hospital where their mother is convalescing. The light, the children’s voices, and the waltzing score (by Hisaishi) all radiate joy.Tatsuo stands with his arms akimbo, beaming at their new home. Satsuki and Mei laugh as they cartwheel around the yard.Satsuki seems in charge of the move: her father is well meaning but absent minded. He drops a piece of furniture. Satsuki bravely opens the kitchen.Satsuki’s acceptance of familial responsibility is heartfelt, and never evinces resentment or questioning, in a properly Japanese manner. In spite of her young age, she is often seen to act in loco parentis while her father is away, most critically when Mei goes missing for the second time.Satsuki runs for miles looking for her, following the same roads as the moving truck did some months before. This time she is utterly alone. A farmer by the side of the road cannot help. Two passers-by on a motorcycle offer only surprise at the great distance she has just run. (This is one of those moments when I cried, others laughed)After much searching, the ordeal ends in a sudden deus-ex machina. Totoro and his companions find Mei, reunite the Kusakabe family.In the closing scene, the mother jokes that she wants to “spoil” the children when she comes home. They all laugh, and everything is back to normal. But how could it be? Having so lately contemplated the death of her sister and mother, how could Satsuki just “go back to normal?”“Let’s laugh to keep ghosts away”Near the beginning of the film, the girls and their father are taking a bath when a miraculously strong wind shakes the house. Their father puts on a silly faces and tells them to “laugh to keep the bogeymen away.” Their forced laughs turn to real ones as they play in the bath.As I watched this scene I felt uncomfortable. These antics are a distraction: their emotion is forced. Laughter sublimates worry, but ultimately cannot resolve its causes. Tatsuo cannot inhabit his daughters’ world: he can only view it from the outside. He cannot air their innermost feelings.Embodying TotoroSatsuki is the only member of the cast who reflects on the possibility of loss. Only she voices her concern for her mother’s health. Maybe this is why she is most in touch with the magical world of “Totoro,” who appears when loss is near at hand.Satsuki first encounters Totoro when her father fails to return home on the bus. Totoro appears beside her, waiting for his own (cat)bus. Before departing, he gives Satusuki a package of seeds, and when her father returns moments later her excitement at meeting Totoro has washed away her worry and fatigue. Later, Totoro and company help Satsuki and Mei sprout those seeds while they sleep, “setting down roots” in their new home.Totoro embodies the way that imaginative play helps children to resolve worries which are beyond their capacity to express. Satsuki and Mei turn challenging situations into adventures with Totoro, allowing them to work through difficult emotions.TeleologyPerhaps this (admittedly bizarre) reading of Totoro as a sort of friendly bogeyman, an embodiment of childhood anxieties is self-indulgently autobiographical.But, as a more reasoned explanation, I’ll instead air some thoughts on the similarities between Totoro and Spirited Away, arguing that key themes introduced in the former are only fully explored in the latter.Both feature a strong female protagonist (Satsuki/Chihiro) who, while in the process of moving house, enters a mystical land where her feelings of alienation and dislocation become embodied in fantastic beings (Totoro/Spirits) which she must supplicate in order to overcoming her fears and set down roots in her new home.Viewed in this sense, Spirited Away is by far the more effective film. There, we feel a loneliness in Sen/Chihiro that we only glimpse in Satsuki, and the thematic material is much more evenly worked, the cast pruned to place the focus on the central drama of the heroine: Mei replaced by Chihiro’s parents, turned into pigs; the time in the spirit land akin to Tatsuo’s absence and the token character of the ailing mother is cut altogether.This comparison suggests an indefensible teleological concept of Ghibli’s filmography. But maybe it’s an interesting supposition on this, the thirtieth anniversary of Ghibli’s most beloved film.What’s wrong with cute?Totoro remains popular with good reason. The luminous settings and earnest characters remind me of the magical (if perhaps totally imaginary) summers of childhood. Yet other scenes, like that of Mei sitting by solemn stone statues on a forlorn hillside in the setting sun, or of Satsuki frantically search for her sister, remain as well, unsettling me still.I had hoped that Totoro would revive those childhood joys. Still charming as ever, Totoro had a different tone for me. I hope that it will be as different the next time.","categories": ["film"],

        "title": "'On Executions' I: The Actual Death Penalty",
        "excerpt":"(This post is one of a series on the death penalty. You can find the others here)I recently spoke in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition. In researching my position (a position which I wouldn’t defend in private conversation) I realized that the debate over state executions has far broader consequences than I had anticipated.A brief survey of the literature turns up many texts on the history of the death penalty and on strategies for abolition, but very few “pro death penalty” texts. In general the “academic stance” is one of opposition, and the focus of most scholarship is not even why we ought to eliminate the death penalty so much as how to effect that goal.I hope to use this series to compile some of the thoughts I’ve had about the death penalty. Each post will discuss an aspect of the debate: an argument, a perspective, a historical trend. Though the stance I adopted for the sake of the debate was anti-abolitionist, I am not convinced of the position. Although I personally believe that the death penalty rarely, if ever, be applied, I find the literature on abolition insufficiently self-critical, a fault which I hope to emend.Before turning to philosophical arguments in later posts, I will briefly discuss practical concerns about the actual application of the death penalty in the United States. I don’t think that this evidence is enough to necessitate the abolition of the death penalty, but it may suggest a moratorium on such punishment.Executions, Here and AbroadState use of capital punishment has been in decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence and increased in subsequent years.Thus, in the “developed world,” the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate.In the United States, approval for capital punishment hovers around 50-60%. The supreme court has continued to apply ever tighter restrictions on the application of the death penalty: it may not be mandatory, it may not be applied to those who offended as minors, and may not be applied to the insane, and generally may not be applied for non-capital crimes. These rulings are in keeping with the doctrine that the death penalty is not inherently cruel and unusual, although its application should be restricted.ConcernsThe actual implementation of the death penalty has been subject to much scrutiny, especially concerning the ostensible presence of racial bias and the costs of sentencing and execution.Pre-Furman, there was a strong bias towards executing Blacks which some scholars have linked to southern cultures of lynching. Post-Furman, it is generally accepted that there is no significant racial bias on the perpetrator’s race, but there is bias on the victim’s race, in executions for capital crimes.The state, in general, is more likely to execute if the victim is white than if the victim is black. This is a troubling indication that perhaps, statistically “Black Lives (don’t) Matter” when it comes to the lives of murder victims.Nonetheless, the same study shows that the total rate of execution for whites is about twice that of the rate of execution for blacks (7.8% vs 3.8%).Furthermore, the supreme court has ruled that while the presence of a racial bias should be rectified, it is not in itself cause to reason that the death penalty is unconstitutional.The death penalty is enormously expensive in the United States, primarily due to legal costs associated with the complex capital appeals process. Nonetheless, 11% of executees post-Furman were volunteers (i.e. they waived their right to present mitigating evidence at their sentencing trial). Their legal costs are undoubtedly less.While studies on the cost of housing an inmate for life (and most are not in fact housed for the remainder of their natural lives) vary in their estimates, most agree that, as implemented and for most kinds of criminals, the costs associated with execution are greater than those of life imprisonment.The Burden of ProofPractical concerns aside, who has the burden of proof? That is, should we presume capital punishment morally justified unless proven otherwise, or vice versa? In the absence of convincing arguments either way, what ought the state to do?Basic principles of liberal democracies assert that the state may not invade upon the lives of its citizens unless doing so provably achieves some justly some aim which its constituents license it to seek. This manifests itself in the Principle of Minimal Invasion: the state must use the least invasive means possible to achieve its legitimate goals.Thus, it would seem that it falls upon supporters of the death penalty to justify its application.

        "title": "Art Languages: BWV 988",
        "excerpt":"When I mentioned to an acquaintance that I’d been thinking about J.S. Bach’s “Goldberg” variations he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording, which I did. (You can listen to it here)The instrument sounds like a modern revival harpsichord equipped with 16’, 4’, nasard, buff, which Richter uses in all combinations, often changing registration on the (not always observed) repeats, sometimes even within phrases. His touch is organistic, his tempi mostly plausible but momentarily uneven, and with little sense of meter or momentum. Color subordinates counterpoint and linear structure. Each variation becomes a pièce de caractère. (A pièce richtère?)Stranger than recording is the comments section (O anomic haven for the disenfranchised!), full of panegyrics (and a few poorly aimed invectives) from armchair critics wielding preference as a token of refinement. “Very serious and not easy-listening” writes one. This practice of virtue-signalling takes on another form “HIP connoisseur” who savors “rare” music as a sign of discrimination.How did have such a high opinion of a recording which would never sell today? Perhaps they, from outside the HIP bubble, heard it in a way that I could not. To give them the benefit of the doubt, I resolved to think more on the question of Richter’s aesthetics.StakesThe recording in question was made at the beginning of the decade which saw the flourishing of CM Wein and the foundation of such groups as the AoAM, Concerto Vocale, and Les Arts Florissants. In short, the success in earnest of the period-instrument/HIP movement. In reevaluating Richter, we are also reevaluating HIP’s ascent, and its aesthetic principles.We begin from the perspective of skepticism: sketicism that theAt least, we must explain why our tastes have changed.ProgressThe consensus in my musical circles (the ones that care for Bach, at least) is that romantic performances of Bach (and Richter’s is a very late and relatively inoffensive one) are products of an age lacking in essential knowledge about the context of ancient music, and hence lacking in essential merit.I take it as fact that today’s esteemed scholar/performers know more about the life and times of JSB than Richter – some documents had not been brought to light at the time – but this fact is not an etiology.Even those performers that who take the (neo-platonic?) view that, ex-ante, the informed performance is the better one should concede that the question of Richter’s popularity (or rejection) is a question of aesthetics and recordings, not of virtues and musicians. We do not, in principle, care whether Richter acted rightly, rather we should care that the recording is good or beautiful, as we experience it, and try to understand it on its terms and our own.As musicians know, the well-informed are not always the best performers: the proof must be in the execution, and we cannot close this aesthetic argument with a summary of the player’s beliefs and values.SuspicionOne reason why the quasi-scientific narrative of “learned performance is better performance” bothers me is because it bears a troubling resemblance to the teleological “establishment classical” reading of organology (advanced by a recent CSO pre-concert lecture) that asserts that the orchestral instruments did not fully mature until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By this argument, the broader compasses, dynamic ranges, and (a)tonalities which are easily producible with modern instruments makes then better tools for the job. But, to parody the HIP stance, what is a learned mind but a better tool?ToolsIn the sense that  both the EM and establishment camps have a teleological argument for their “modern” performance practice.Only HIP (pace Butt, Haynes) is a kind of modish modernism that asserts that it has fully integrated all cultures, past and present, freeing itself from the shackles of the institution.Reading RichterBut where does that leave Richter?Performing on a harpsichord in a stylePerhaps the HIP moment was borne out of a reactionary nostalgia for an irrecoverable moment when western musical culture was monolithic and tasteful. Worse, perhaps it was a commercially successful reactionary movement.The artist, free from the confines of capital, is a romantic idea. We need only look to the published and dedicated outputs of any working composer/musician of the early modern period for evidence that art-for-pay is as old as pay itself, only the transactors have changed. The dedicatee of the “Brandenburgs” was Margrave. The “dedicatee” of the modern concert performance is the LCD concert-goer who will not to pay to hear more adventurous early-music.Besides being commercially and musically of fashion among  teleological view of musical/organological.The fact that HIP has enjoyed such commercial success is no less discomforting. Adorno’s critique of HIP as a “culture of restoration”not the least bit because of how deeply enmeshed I am in communities of historical performance.When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called “Goldberg Variations,” he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording (which you can hear here)Even before I had listened to the recording, I was deeply skeptical and frankly doubted whether it had any artistic merit at all. In my musical circles (among them HIP musicians and recorder players) romantic interpretions of Bach are generally looked down upon as relics of a time which did not benefit from the wealth of information now readily available on the life and times of JSB, a knowledge which these musicians, paradigmatically, as essential to the tasteful, indeed to the “good” performance of this music.The relationship between scholarship and performance is also unclear. Perhaps, knwoing the biographical facts of the composer’s life, his societal position and the social pressures upon him, will change our performance, but how? And why should we believe that the changes are for the better?We may take it as a fact that knowledge of period performance practice was less widespread in 1970 than now, but this does not account for differences in taste. The subsequent decade would see the flourishing of CM Wein, the foundation of the AoAM, Concerto Vocale and Les Arts Florrissants: clearly HIP was in the air.ImpressionsIs music an activity of the body, or the soul?Richter and SchiffSo here’s some of what I’ve been thinking about, which has been changing and expanding as I write.One question is “How do we prepare for/perform/recognize a good ‘modern’ performance of the Goldberg variations?” With particular reference to recordings in question: Richter, Schiff, and my imaginary “mental ideal HIP” performance (because I can’t find a HIP one that I like enough to use as an example, maybe Rondeau).The question is closely tied to (in the same order as trichotomy of preparation/performance/reception “is music about souls (of musicians), movements, or recordings/sonic experiences?”When HIP musicians ask this question, preparation (foreknowledge of the work, its circumstances, its place in relation trends in music history and composition) is paramount to the performance, but this is a concern for performers, not for critics. As listeners to the music, we must be primarily concerned with the actual movements and sounds, not as much with the knowledge/beliefs of the performer. We should try to connect prepartion to performance (the movements) and the sound experience in order to justify different kinds of preparation on listener aesthetic grounds.I wish to argue that the critical thing that makes Early Music/HIP special is that it prioritizes music as an action physically enacted by bodies, and rather than seeing the physical laws of motion that govern performance as limitations, it takes them to be principles essential to the composition of the works, and essential to their performance. Dance, the way that modies move through space, weight of the hands on keys/bows, momentum, velocity. This is a philosophy based primarily on performance. Here, the music is maybe like a transcript of motions.Richter, on the other hand, prioritizes the soul, artistic inspiration over the mechanics of performance or the actual end result (he is said to have been pleased that his interpretations frequently changed). This is an essentially romantic concept of the music: the composer (and by extension, the performer) as an inspired genius channelling the ineffable. Here, music is like a platonic form or pure concept.The modern post-industrial/mechanistic paradigm might by summarized as being about outcomes. What matters is consistency in the actual production of the sound, range of sounds possible to be produced. This is a philosophy of music focused on sonic outcomes. Here, music is like a sonic experience or sound recording.Using this trichotomy, inqiure about Richter’s practice: in what ways does its practice fail to take into account certain factors which led to the composition of the work? One critical way: meter, physics, dance, movement of bodies is removed from the picture. Counterpoint too, as a simulation of many individual instruments, is muddied. This generates many of the things I find “unpleasant” about it.Schiff, on the other hand has a strong sense of meter and counterpoint, but perhaps comes out a bit “bland” in terms of performance (the movements) in being conventionally regulated in the manner of Modern Classical post-mechanistic play.Another way in which they differ is in their use of the affordances of their instrument: Richter uses few of the affordances of the harpsichord, well the only one really: note length. On the other hand, Schiff makes use of the piano color in a useful way. This also gets at the reasons why we should play on period instruments in the first place: partly it is because of the sound that they produce, but also the way in whcih the feeling of the instrument informs the play style. If, as in Richter’s case, the instrument only vaguely approximates the feelings of play and the sound, why should we think it a better instrument than, say, the hammered dulcimer, the modern piano or the (anachronistic) unfretted clavichord?So which is the better “modern” performance: I argue Schiff. For his clearer projection of the physicality of the music, use of an instrument whose affordances are used to the fullest. In the ideal HIP recording, we could use a sound informed more by the feeling of play, and by physicality, the aspects of performance most critical to the interpretation.Intuitively, I disliked the recording. But in trying to explain my reaction to it, I was reminded that questions of taste are, contrary to the common saying, much to be disputed.I may devote another post(s) to further quesitons on musical aesthetics, but for the sake of brevity, I will here focus on a single aspect of the Richter’s recording: timing.Notating timeScores direct a musician to place notes in time, but the notation (especially considering the sparse notition of BWV 988 and its type) is imprecise. Among generalities, we can notes of the same value should have roughly the same duration. Some notes should occur simultaneously, some not. Perhaps a “staccato” dotted eight with a sixteenth followed by a sixteenth rest or similar.But beyond the general outlines of how decisions like the interpretation of “slur” marks, the setting of a general “tempo,” the use of rubato (even, seemingly, the definition of the term), and the","categories": [null,""],

        "excerpt":"Derek Parfit proposes the following situation in “Reasons and Persons” (1984)  Suppose that a certain club [meets regularly] for several years [then ceases to meet]. Some years later, some of the members of this club form a club with the same name, and the same rules. We ask: ‘Have these people reconvened the very same club? Or have they merely started up another club, which is exactly similar?’ Suppose that there is no rule [explaining how the club could be reconvened] and that the people involved, if they asked our question, would not give it an answer.In such a situation, according to Parfit, the question “Is this the same club?” has no answer. To use Parfit’s term, the question is “empty.”Describing the “emptiness,” Parfit writes  Different answers to our question are merely different descriptions of [the facts]. This is why, without answering this empty question, we can know everything that there is to know. [The answers to this question] are not here two different possibilities, one of which must be trueParfit then applies the idea of “empty questions” to questions of identity. For example, “What portion of my brain would have to be replaced with pieces of your brain for me to become you?” Clearly, if we replaced all of my brain with all of your brain, I would be (for all intents and purposes) you. If we were to replace only a tiny portion of my brain with a piece of yours, I would arguably still be me. (This seems no more damaging to my identity than, say, some slight brain damage.)In the middle of this spectrum, things get murky. If I really am “me” at one end and “you” at the other, there should be some dividing line where I stop being me and start being you. Parfit arguest that while we could set such a dividing line arbitrarily (say, at 50% replacement), doing so would not tell us anything that we didn’t know beforehand. We can know exactly how much brain matter was exchanged, exactly how the resultant persons will behave, and still not be able to definitively set a dividing line.This quality of emptiness is similar to Matthew Kramer’s “vague concepts,” which I encountered in Ethics of Capital Punishment. In Ethics,Consider Matthew Kramer “vague concepts” in the context of criminal law. When we ask whether someone is “evil enough” to be deserving of death, we must decide upon a threshold, but this threshold can only be “good enough.” Kramer contends that we should accept doing “well enough” because every defense, every prosecution, must use such vague concepts as “culpability,” “harm,” and “intent.” A criminal justice system which never set such thresholds would be totally ineffectual.What’s questioning?Perhaps, to use a metaphorical turn of phrase, questions which are not empty are “pregnant” or perhaps","categories": ["philosophy"],

What a tree for the entire lexicon look like?The Topology of EtymologyWithout actually constructing such a network, we can describe its topology.Imagine a network where each node is a “definition” of a word. If a word A is one of the most recent ancestor of B, A points to B. For example,  OFr. “hercier” would point to to “hearse” and “rehearsal.” This relation is irreflexive, as a word cannot descend from itself. Further we may forbid loops, as a word may not descend from one of its descendants. (n.b This implies that the relation is asymmetric) Thus, we can succinctly say that  Def. An etymological network on a corpus C is a directed acyclic graph on a superset of C with the binary relation “”Because it seems likely that there were fewer words in the ancient languages, I’m guessing that this graph will look vaguely like a polytree, with its roots being roots in the appropriate proto-language. (For English, mostly Proto-Indo-European) The graph will probably have a maximum path length of less than ten (average maximal path length probably around five) judging my my experience with the “number of steps” in most etymologies, although I would be interested to see what the maximal paths looks like.I’m also interested in the connectedness of the graph. If there were two disconnected components, for example, this would tell us that there are two families of words which share no common roots or intermediaries. There are like two lexical families. It’s hard for me to say whether such lexical isolates exist. If there are minimally connected families (for example, families which share a single intermediary ancestor) what words are the bridges? These are some of the topological questions that would be answered by the construction of such a network.Practical ChallengesWhile the necessary information is publicly available, it would be prohibitively tedious to compile it by hand. Probably better would would be to scrape it from some standardized etymology source. Unfortunately, it seems that no such source exists. Most etymologies are verbal descriptions, brief histories of words. Another problem is the resolution of conflicting etymologies, and the procuring of sources for the more difficult dead intermediary languages. All of these present significant challenges to the compilation of any substantial and accurate such network.Nonetheless, if we only care about investigating the general structure of such a network and restrict ourselves to a fairly small corpus of “modern” words, it should be possible.As I proof of concept, I plan to compile such a tree by hand.

Such false people are dubbed “snakes” or “two-faced.” The obsession of reality TV with confessional revelation of the true self is also implicated in the perpetuation of this idea of the self.Probably, the idea of authenticity has its roots, too, in the psychoanalytic tradition of exposing and actualizing the unconscious mind.","categories": [null,""],

        "title": "Debate: Assisted Suicide, Part I",
        "excerpt":"(the first of two posts, in which I describe my fellow debaters’ arguments and respond to them)I recently spoke in a debate on the motion “people have a right to die,” arguing that people have a right to die, along with a collection of other moral and political views. I don’t think that I sufficiently addressed the other debaters’ arguments, and I feel that my view was incoherent. Indeed, it was largely improvised. So I wish to try again, summarizing the arguments of the other debaters and formulating my own, more coherent, view.It is worth noting that this was really a debate on assisted suicide and other forms of killing. I believe that “right to die” is merely a euphemism, not a fundamentally deep question whose answer will reveal something about the nature of what is right or good. We should care about whether we act rightly, and whether society is organized in the best possible way. While we may try to answer these questions in the framework of rights. Rights are simply a terminology with which we try to answer these fundamental ethical and political questions. In order to avoid misunderstanding, we should approach the these questions head on, addressing what really matters without preconceptions.The two speakers who argued that people don’t/shouldn’t have a right to die presented a single coherent view so I’ll address their arguments together. My partner and I had differing views so I describe his separately.I don’t have a recording of the debate, but I have tried to represent all arguments to the best of my memory, and with the greatest charity. I will respond to these arguments with my own, revised, arguments.Against a right to die: Students for LifeIs it wrong to commit suicide? On this, the anti-legalization side conceded that an argument in favor of the immorality of suicide might require the existence of a higher power.Nonetheless, they argued that legal acknowledgment of a “right to die” shows a lack of appreciation for the value of human life. Suppose that we have legally recognized a “right to die.” Consider the following line of reasoning:  Alice is suffering. Perhaps she is terminally ill. She reasons “I am no longer useful. My life is not worth living as it adds nothing to the collective good. In fact, I am a drain on society. So it would be better that I end my life.”Societal recognition (de facto or de jure legalization, constitutional enshrinement of such a right e.g.) of assisted suicide helped to legitimize Alice’s reasoning. Such reasoning, they argue, displays a fundamental lack of appreciation for human life, both on Alice’s part and the part of the lawmakers. This kind of reasoning treats human life as a mere means to collective good, rather than as an end in itself. No one would like to live in such a society. We should value all human life, and instead Alice to end her own life, we should try to relieve her suffering.Additionally, they cast doubt on the idea that Alice’s suicide can be rational. Although the future seems bleak, she does not know what her future holds, so how does she know that death will be better than the alternative? They contended that in the the face of such doubt, society should try to alleviate her suffering rather than encouraging her to take her own life.The two members of SfL also raised practical concerns about the regulation of assisted suicide in practice, citing a case in the Netherlands where a woman with Alzheimer’s who had consented to being euthanized when her “mind was gone” had to be restrained in order to deliver a lethal injection.Another case is that of a patient in a persistent vegetative state who is disconnected from life support by his family members or doctors. Such a case is sometimes called “letting die” as opposed to “killing.” They asserted that letting die is morally different from physician assisted suicide but did not specify how.For a right to die: My partnerMy partner’s view paid homage to Locke and Mill. We own our bodies (cf. Locke) and thus may dispose of them as we please, as we would our other possessions, as long as we don’t harm others in the process (cf. Mill). Suicide (destruction of the body) is a direct result of our self-ownership. (n.b. Locke did not support suicide, as he believed that )He emphasized that assisted suicide is not really a choice to die, as we will all die some day. It is most accurately described as a matter of deciding when to die. If we are utilitarians or egoistic hedonists we may believe that, in the face of sure and intense suffering, we may prefer not to live at all. Furthermore, if we are universal utilitarians, we may believe that the ending of these people’s lives would be better for everyone, so long as they die by their own volition.How do we disagree?Both of the views I have just described are incomplete, as would be any view on this complex issue as articulated in a ten minute speech. While my summary doesn’t do them justice, even under the most charitable completions, both views must This is what makes the issue of assisted suicide so fruitful.I think that the disagreement between these largely consists in differing understanding of the nature of the entities at hand: the state, the person, and rights (for rights are things, albeit metaphysical). Thus, my response must discuss the necessary properties of those entities under each view, examining the consequences, and presenting a more accurate view.In addition, to the structural problems which all points of view faced, the debate did not consider important practical problems like the moral relevance of the participation of another party in a suicide, the moral significance of intention and the nature of persons. I hope to say something on these matters.RightsAs I reiterated during the debate, I feel that it is misleading to frame the issue of assisted suicide with the concept of the framing of “rights.” Without explicit recognition, each side used a different idea of rights. Rather than try to resolve this difference in favor of any single view, I believe that we should set aside the concept altogether.Rights give us duties and responsibilities. Property rights, for example, invoke a bundle of duties imposed upon others regarding what they may do to another’s property. You may not, without my permission, use, destroy, modify etc. my property. But these rights may be overridden. Suppose that I use my car to block your driveway. By using my car to hinder your legitimate use of your driveway, I forfeit some of the rights which I have over my car in other spaces.Some people believe that there are rights which may not be overridden, such as the right to life. Perhaps such rights exist but the right to life is regularly forfeited, and is thus not among them. For example, if I attack you it is reasonable to suppose that you might act in self defense and harm or kill me. Criminals, enemy combatants, casualties of war may all be legitimately killed by the state.What matters in all of these cases is not rights qua rights, but rather the obligations that rights entail. The system of rights proposes that there is a property invariant among people (rights) that entails certain duties, and such a system is only as good as it correctly describes and explains the duties that we have towards one another and to ourselves.But as we have seen above, the system of rights hardly provides the invariant we are looking for. While they do capture an aspect of common-sense belief about what is right and wrong, their explanatory power is weakened because they are not truly invariant. A system with many exceptions is not systemic, unless the exceptions them are systematic. And if the exceptions are systematic, we should try to understand why.Rather we should directly ask about reasons, beliefs and facts without presuming that the framework of rights is the best reductive explanatory line of inquiry.Regarding assisted suicide, we should try to answer the following questions:Moral questions:  When is it morally permissible to kill oneself?  When is it rational to kill oneself?  When is it morally permissible to kill a person with their ongoing consent?  When is it morally permissible to kill an incompetent person with their prior consent?  When is it morally permissible to kill an person with their consent?Political questions:  When should suicide be legal?  When should assisted suicide be legal?I believe that the views summarized above fail to satisfactorily address some or all of the questions above, or fail for structural reasons.Defeasing the “norm” argument(this form of argument is due to Brennan and Jaworski)Suppose that we grant that rights (at least in some limited sense) societal norms that indicate values that we legally uphold and reflect societal attitudes. SfL concluded that acknowledging a right to assisted suicide shows a disregard for human life, and no person would want to live in a society that disregarded human life.Setting aside for a moment whether legal acknowledgement of assisted suicide does in fact display a regard for humanity, we can question whether it is necessarily so. Perhaps it would be better if we had some other disposition towards assisted suicide. Consider the following example (based on the Fore people of Papua New Guinea)  The Fore people believed that the proper way to show respect for their dead was to eat their brains. They said “Burying and burning are for garbage! Interring or cremating our dead treats them like garbage. We should treasure their souls by eating their brains.”  But they learned that cannibalism (especially of brains) transmits the incurable neurodegenerative disease called Kuru, killing hundreds every year. So they changed their customs. Some were at first uncomfortable with the idea of burying their dead, but they found it acceptable if it alleviated the suffering caused by the Kuru disease. Over time their customs changed, and now suffers slow mental decline and death from Kuru.As the example of the Fore illustrates, societal attitudes about the meanings of our actions are contingent. Acknowledging assisted suicide human life does not necessarily disregard human life, just as cannibalism was not necessary to show respect for the dead. Societal norms have often been revised in our own society. Take moral attitudes about the moral significance of race, or gender.Just as the suffering from Kuru justified a changed in the Fore people’s values and funerary practices, perhaps intense suffering in the end of life justifies a change in our societal attitudes towards assisted suicide. We should take this concern to heart, and remember that our attitudes are not fixed, and should be changed if we discover other morally significant facts.Perhaps our situation is like this:  We believed that the proper way to show respect for the terminally ill was to never kill, even with consent. We said “Killings like those are for criminals and animals, not for innocent people. We should respect the dignity of their lives and allow them to die.”  But when we came to a more clear understanding of the nature of people, we realized that we could humanely achieve these people’s wishes and alleviate their suffering at the same time. Some people uncomfortable with the idea at first, but they found it acceptable if it alleviated suffering for the terminally ill. Over time customs changed, and now the terminally ill need not suffer.While living in a society which recognizes assisted suicide might make us uncomfortable today, this does not mean that we cannot and should not try to change our attitudes towards the idea. The Fore changed their minds once they learned of the morally significant matters at stake. We may do the same.Thus, the norm argument can be defensibly denied. It remains an open question whether assisted suicide would in fact provide societal benefits, a situation which is not as clear as the causation of cannibalism and Kuru. But it is clear that our attitude towards assisted suicide are not what matters. We should be open to changing our attitude just as the Fore people changed their attitude towards cannibalism. We should view this change with hope and optimism.Aside: What does assisting suicide necessarily say about us?(the example below is due to Parfit “On What Matters” vol. 1)Although I believe that we have sufficient reason to doubt the norm argument after discussing circumstances that can mitigate against it, I wish to briefly consider whether it assisting suicide or committing suicide necessarily reveals something morally significant about our disposition.Say that  Alice encounters a snake in the desert. She believes that 1a) If I stay still the snake will bite me and I will die and 2a) I do not want to die, so she starts to run away. Little does she know that this snake only attacks moving targets. The snake bites her, and she dies.Alice’s beliefs were incorrect, but she did not act irrationally according to those beliefs.  Bob encounters the same snake in the desert. He believes that 1b) If I move, the snake will bite me and I will die and 2b) I want to die, so he starts to run away. The snake bites him, and he dies.Both Alice and Bob die from snake bites.Autonomy and Utilitarianism in ConflictMy partner, arguing for the right to die, drew both on self-determination and utilitarianism to justify assisted suicide. But I believe that these two ideas are in conflict with each other. We may not be true utilitarians and also hold a Lockean view of total self-ownership.Suppose that we hold that people may do whatever they please with their bodies and property, the right which also legitimizes suicide.  I love smoked ham, so I build a smoker in my backyard. But the smoke wafts over the boundaries of my property and annoys many neighbors, but not appreciably to any great extent. But when my neighbors see my smoker, they decide to buy one too. Soon the smog is unbearable for all, although the effect of any single one is insignificant.Rationality of suicideAll parties of the debate considered the question of whether suicide can be rational. This matters because irrationality is often used as justification for paternalism. If we are paternalists with regard to irrationality, we should act to prevent people from committing irrational suicides.So independent of the justification of paternalism, we may wish to argue for suicide’s rationality/irrational.Utility and human dignitySfL also argued that utilitarianism treats people as mere means. When people are no longer useful to society, they should be killed or kill themselves. I believe that this version of utilitarianism is too easy a target. We can simply revise our utility function to include preference satisfaction.Utility as preference satisfaction suffers from well known problems such as the “utility monster,” a person who derives immense utility from killing others, such that the utility reaped by doing so outweighs any negative effects on his victims and their families.Nonetheless,Why not regulate?What do you regulate?Death by contractantimis-characterizing rightsmis-characterizing utilitarianismrights as societal normswhy wouldn’t we want to live in such a society?skirting the moral problemsnot legislate: ambivalence.

His doctors believe that he will not regain consciousness. They judge, correctly, that without continual life-support he will perish quickly.

        "excerpt":"TemporalityOver the course of my life, I may value different things at different times, I may begin and cease to value things, and I may value only particular instances of things.Consider the following case  Years ago when I began to teach, I valued my teaching because I idealistically believed that I could make a difference. Now, I am jaded. I believe that such efforts are futile. I no longer value teaching.When I began to teach, I was a personThe talk focused on an arguemnt arising from a theory of what it means to “value” something that led to an ostensibly repugnant conclusion. Callard called the theory the “hybrid theory of valuing.” I present the theory, which Callard asserts is commonly accpeted by those in the field, to the best of my memory.On the Hybrid Theory, full fledged valuing of a thing A involves three dispositions  Belief that A is value (in a general sense)  Desire for A  Emotional vulnerability towards A (The nature of this disposition was not made abundantly clear, but it may not matter)In conflict with this kind of valuing are situations of “value breakdown”  Case 1: My father dies. I still value him, a fact evinced by my grief. But I fail to meet the desire requirement because I cannot desire what is impossible: I cannot desire to bring about his presence.  Case 2: As a student, I strongly valued having a career in philosophy, but when I realize that there are no jobs in my AOS, I am crushed. My emotional response signals that I have a kind of value for the thing, but like how I cannot desire a dead relative, I cannot desire what I believe to be impossible.Callard then suggested the following exploratory line of argument.In these cases, valuing is in some way defective, for our valuing of the thing in question leads us to experience mental injury. These kinds of mental injury have all the characterstics of mental illness, but they are caused by normal everyday occurrences. So we are forced to suppose that all negative emotions (or at least a large part of them) are mental illness.Callard seemed to think that most would be reluctant to accept such a conclusion. I am not. It seems to me that mental illness are matters degree, not of kind. While neurotic or irrational thoughts are the characteristic of mental illnesses, they are present in all minds. We all need some fear, for example fear of being hit by cars when hit when crossing the street, in order to go on living. When these fears are overwhelming and not in accordance with the real threats, perhaps we are deeply afraid of being injured even when sitting at home alone, we call this a mental illness.Is value-breakdown defective?One way in which we can break the aforementioned line of reasoning is to argue that the kind of valuing in Cases 1 and 2 are not full fledged valuing. I believe that this is not necessary. In Case 1, I believe that what we mean when we say that we value","categories": ["philosophy"],

        "excerpt":"Until its fifth and most recent edition of 2013, Diagnostics and Statistics Manual, the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic handbook included a “bereavement exception.”Perhaps this is what Agnes Callard had in mind at the informal seminar she held on 3/2 at a University of Chicago undergraduate dorm. Callard associate professor of philosophy at The University and author “Aspiration: The Agency of Becoming” (2017, OUP).We began with an explanation of the Hybrid Theory of Valuing (hence H). H tries to explain what it means to value something. H aims to me a necessary and sufficient condition for “full-fledged-valuing” the disposition that we may have to our friends, or that a classical music lover may have to attending the symphony. On H, it is not enough to simply believe that classical music is valuable. According to H, valuing classical music is different from merely believing that it is valuable.On H, full fledged valuing of a thing A involves three things  Belief that A is valuable (in a general sense)  Desire for A  Emotional vulnerability towards A (The nature of this disposition was not made abundantly clear, but it may not matter)Callard claimed that this description of valuing is held by most philosophers working in the field.The focus of the talk was not the theory of valuing explicity, but an argument which drew reached an “undesirable” conclusion with H as a predicate. Callard presented the argument roughly as follows.  Suppose that we hold the Hybrid Theory of Valuing, H. When we lose something or someone we value, we can no longer fulfill the second condition of H because we cannot desire what we know to be impossible (i.e. the bringing about of that which was lost). This form of valuing is also defective because it causes us pain. Nonetheless, we may sensibly say that we still value what is lost (e.g. I value my relationship with my father, now dead). But, inasmuch as this assertion opposes the truth of H, and causes us pain, it is best described as a form of mental illness.In speculation, Callard also wondered whether we could thus dub all negative emotions to be a form of mental illness. We can summarize the conclusions thus:  C: Bereavement is a form of mental illness  D: (strong form) all negative emotions are mental illnessCallard invited us to attempt to avoid these conclusions by rejecting a premise or an argument made along the way.ResponseI believe that C and D are both true, inasmuch as the presence of mental illness is a matter of degree rather than of kind. To use Parfit’s apt term, it is an empty question because we may know all the relevant facts about a person’s mental processes without concluding that they are “mentally ill” or “not mentally ill.”Consider that, even positing that levels of neurotic emotion can be directly compared between minds, the appropriate level of neuroticism is a matter of personal preference. A rational fear of being hit by cars keeps us safe cross the street. An overwhelming fear of being hit by cars might be paralyzing but we all have different tolerances for such fear and such risks.The same goes for feelings of sadness or anger. Perhaps I feel that my sadness is a rational response to the iniquity of the world, that to feel otherwise would be to live ignorant of the suffering of many. Perhaps such a disposition is my preference. Labeling this extended sadness as a mental illness does not meaningfully add to our understanding of the facts involved.But while I believe that we should hold C and D on the aforementioned grounds, I believe that we should reject the line of reasoning which Callard presented. We should hold C and D on other grounds.Valuing the lostCallard’s argument relies on a notional understanding of valuing that says that one can still value a thing that has been lost, or that is not believed to be impossible. For example, when I say that I valued my relationship with my dead father, I should be able to still value it even now. I believe that this is notionally incorrect.If I were to say “I value my father,” I have implied that the thing in question is ongoing: my father is persisting. If I were to say “I valued my father” we might be led to believe that my father is not longer alive, or perhaps I no longer value him because I have had some fundamental realization about him, so he no longer meets condition 1 of H.Tensed statements like these make much more sense. When we pine for the lost relative, we invoke their memory, say “would that my father were here.” We may even try to bring about the recreation of the lost thing: perhaps we fix a broken object or try a seance. These are all ways in which our value is notionally real, but they all appeal to a future potentiality.Desiring what is impossibleI take issue with the desire clause 2 of H. The clear difference between the classical music concert goer and the person who believes that classical music is merely valuable in the abstract is not desire, it is the reasonable effort to bring the thing about for himself. The non-concert-goer does not try to bring it about for himself, but he may, out of beneficence, gift his ticket to another, so that he might enjoy the concert.If we believe (mistakenly) that we may bring about the resurrection of a dead relative, we may legitimately try to bring about their presence, and thus legitimately value them.If we say we value them but do not try to bring about their presence, it is simply more accurate to say that we valued them. More particularly, we valued our time with them, which has drawn to a close. This is notionally acceptable.If we are mistaken about what is possible, we may be deceiving ourselves. Perhaps if we deceive ourselves into feeling that we may bring a dead person back to life, we are deluded. And this delusion may cause us pain.Begin deceivedAccording to Plato, being deceived about the nature of the truth is one of the worst things that can happen to a man. But our priorities differ. To make a universal claim about self-deception is to make a universal claim about what matters. I probably hold mistaken beliefs about many fundamental questions, but I’m not perturbed by this. This is merely a matter of personal values.Another problem arises from the continuity of identity over time. Take the following situation.  I value my friend Joe. But ever since he suffered a traumatic brain injury a year ago, he has not been himself. I no longer wish to spend time with him. In the abstract, I still love my brother but he is so changed as to make it difficult for me to believe that. Perhaps I don’t really value him at all.Here are some potential explanationsFirst suppose that I really do not value Joe since his accident and suppose that he did not die in the accident, that he is essentially the same person as before.Then  My opinion of Joe changed. Either his identity is the same and it was not in fact his personal identity that mattered to me, but some other extraneous aspect of his being. Or, his identity is what mattered, and I simply changed my mind about whether I valued him as a person.Both of these explanations seem notionally wrong. Clearly, I valued Joe before his injury, and clearly his personal identity mattered. So we should either reject that I no longer value Joe, concluding that I do in fact value Joe. Or we should reject that Joe is the same person. I believe that we should take the latter response.The case of my father’s death is similar to that of the “death” of Joe. While it may be distressing to be around Joe in his new state as a person, we should realize that what we valued was a person who is now dead. Accordingly, we can reject that we value Joe sentimentally. We should do the same for my father’s death.I doubt that there are many objects which are really as continues as the argument of value breakdown requires. Consequently, we should feel free to reject the breakdown of value at any point in time, just as we should feel free to reject the continuous identity of objects.","categories": ["philosophy"],
