I read and write, but not nearly as much as I ought to. My interests include musicology, organology, intellectual history, aesthetics, ethics, philosophy of law and politics, and linguistics.

Lately, I've been thinking lately about

* The Historically Informed Performance movement
* Authenticity as an ethical ideal
* Parfit's theories of personal identity and ethics
* Aesthetics of Islamic art
* Sexual consent in philosophy and the law
* Capital punishment
