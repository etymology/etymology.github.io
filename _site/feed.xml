&lt;p&gt;Totoro was my introduction to Japanese animation and I have fond memories of watching it as a child. Like the protagonistic sisters Satsuki and Mei, I spent many summer days playing outside in gardens, forests or marshes, hoping to catch a glimpse of Totoro or at least a rabbit or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the familiar plot unfolded, I grew nostalgic yet confused. At moments when I was holding back tears, first time viewers (or so I presume) were laughing around me. The sadness was momentary, but the incongruity confirmed to me that the film which I had loved a child was in some way lost. More precisely, my eyes had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following review contains spoilers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibilities&quot;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet the Kusakabe family (Satsuki, Mei, and father Tatsuo) aboard an improbably laden jalopy, rattling its way through the Japanese countryside. We can later infer that they are moving to a house closer to the hospital where their mother is convalescing. The predominant affect is one of radiant joy. Tatsuo stands with his arms akimbo, wearing a pleased smile. Satsuki and Mei laugh as they cartwheel around the yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first scenes, it is Satsuki, not her father, who seems to does most of the moving. As will later learn, the father is well meaning but absent minded. While this mental and physical absence don’t seem negligent, it is telling that he is absent both times Mei goes missing, the first time buried in papers, the second time  off at the university. On each occasion, it falls upon Satsuki to recover her sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki’s acceptance of familial responsibility appears heartfelt. She certainly never resents or questions duty, just as every character in Totoro (in a properly Japanese way) seems to play their proper working role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Satsuki is in late elementary school at the latest, for much of the film she acts &lt;em&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/em&gt;, most critically when Mei goes missing the second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki blames herself, and runs for miles looking for Mei, following the same roads as the moving truck did some months before. This time, though, she is utterly alone. A farmer is of no help. Two passers-by on a motorcycle offer little more than surprise at the great distance that she has run. This moment pained me, but elicited laughs from the theater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ordeal is soon over, though, as Totoro and his companions swoop in to up the loose ends in a deus-ex-machina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the closing scene, the mother jokes that she wants to “spoil” the children for a while when she comes home. They all laugh, everything seems back to normal. But how could it be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having so lately contemplated the death of her sister and mother, how could Satsuki just “go back to normal?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-laugh-to-keep-ghosts-away&quot;&gt;“Let’s laugh to keep ghosts away”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the beginning of the film, the girls and their father are taking a bath when a miraculously strong wind shakes the house. Their father puts on silly faces and tells them (as subtitled) “let’s laugh to keep the bogeymen away.” Their forced laughs turn to real ones as they play in the bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watched this scene I felt uncomfortable. The father’s antics are merely a distraction: the emotion is forced. The fear cannot be real if our laughter is, so goes the axiom. But this attitude, the one which he continues to employ, is an ineffective form of nostalgia for an irrecoverable past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laughter sublimates worry, but ultimately cannot resolve its root causes. Tatsuo cannot inhabit his daughters’ world: he can only view it. And inasmuch as he is not an imanent participant in their internal emotional lives, he cannot air their innermost feelings more than any other adult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embodying-totoro&quot;&gt;Embodying Totoro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki is the only ensemble member who meaningfully reflects on the possibility of loss (crying by the well). Perhaps this is why it is also she is also most able to interface with the magical world of “Totoro,” interacting with him when loss seems to be at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki first encounters Totoro in a moment of despair, after her father fails to return home on the bus. Before departing, Totoro gives the girls a package of seeds, and when their father returns moments later their excitement at meeting Totoro has washed away their worry and fatigue. Later, Totoro and company help Satsuki and Mei sprout those seeds while they sleep, “setting down roots” in their new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totoro embodies the way that imaginative play helps children to resolve worries which are beyond their capacity to express. Satsuki and Mei turn challenging situations into adventures with Totoro, allowing them to work through difficult emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teleology&quot;&gt;Teleology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this (admittedly bizarre) reading of Totoro as a sort of friendly bogeyman, an embodiment of childhood anxieties is self-indulgently autobiographical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as a more reasoned explanation, I’ll instead air some thoughts on the similarities between Totoro and Spirited Away, arguing that key themes introduced in the former are only fully explored in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both feature a strong female protagonist (Satsuki/Chihiro) who, while moving, enters a mystical land where her feelings of alienation and dislocation become embodied in fantastic beings (Totoro/Spirits) which she must supplicate in order to overcoming her fears and set down roots in her new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this sense, Spirited Away is by far the more effective film. There, we feel a loneliness in Sen/Chihiro that we only glimpse in Satsuki, and the thematic material is much more evenly worked, the cast pruned to place the focus on the central drama of the heroine: the object of care, Mei replaced by Chihiro/Sen’s parents, turned into pigs (the time that they are pigs is akin ot the time that the father is at the university) and the token character of the ailing mother is cut altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To compare the films is to suggest a teleological concept of Ghibli’s filmography. This argument is indefensible, but maybe it’s an interesting supposition on this, the thirtieth anniversary of Ghibli’s most beloved film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-wrong-with-cute&quot;&gt;What’s wrong with cute?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totoro remains popular with good reason. At least for me, the luminous settings and earnest characters remind me of the magical (if perhaps totally imaginary) summers of childhood. Yet others, like that of Mei sitting by solemn stone statues on a forlorn hillside in the setting sun, or of Satsuki frantically search for her sister, remain as well, unsettling me still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that Totoro would revive those childhood joys. Still charming as ever, Totoro had a different tone for me. I hope that it will be as different the next time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ben</name><email>etymology@uchicago.edu</email><uri>/about/</uri></author><category term="review" /><category term="Doc Films" /><category term="Studio Ghibli" /><summary type="html">A favorite childhood film now feels sad.

The verb &quot;to rehearse&quot; (13c. &quot;to repeat, give an account of&quot;) comes from Old French &quot;rehercier&quot; (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. &quot;herse&quot; (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across a plowed field to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. The modern sense comes from the late 16th century.

Compare also &quot;hirsute&quot; (hairy, spiny) and &quot;hearse&quot; (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a &quot;herse&quot; for its resemblance to farm tool. The term synecdochically came to refer to the coffin and the vehicle.

    Think of the long trip home.
    Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?
    ...
    “Is it lack of imagination that makes us come
    to imagined places, not just stay at home?
    Or could Pascal have been not entirely right
    about just sitting quietly in one’s room?

    Continent, city, country, society:
    the choice is never wide and never free.
    And here, or there ... No. Should we have stayed at home,
    wherever that may be?”

_-- from Elizabeth Bishop, &quot;Questions of Travel&quot;_

To a fault, my mental activity is dictated by my environment. I require distinct spaces for sleep, socialization, reflection. I'm probably not alone in this.

It recently occurred to me that the spaces most conducive to my creativity are liminal: spaces like the intimate recital hall, convivial dinner table, coffee shop, or reading room, which blend privacy and exposure, familiarity and novelty, in turn fostering a productive balance between contemplation and expression, reduction and synthesis. When these forces are properly balanced, my mind can spin taut conceptual webs. Too much tension and the mental filament tears. Too little and the web is formless, slack.

I hope this blog will be a virtual creative space for the elaboration of my thoughts: a place to try out ideas before a forgiving audience, for mental &quot;re-hearsal,&quot; its content somewhere between a transcript of my internal monologue and a polished work.

I thank my first and most forgiving audience -- my friends -- for their sound advice and for engaging me in helpful conversation, even when it was tedious. Although they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, it would not have come to light without their encouragement. My particular thanks go to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure and to Ronen for inspiring me to start. I am motivated by the thought that you might be reading.
