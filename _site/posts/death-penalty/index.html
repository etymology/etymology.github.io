<p>I recently volunteered to participate in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition although this is not a stance which I would defend in private.</p>

<h3 id="the-state-of-debate">The state of debate</h3>

<p>Why argue for the death penalty if I don’t support it myself? First, because the burden of proof lies upon its supporters. Under the basic principles of liberal democracies (our implicit domain), the use of state power is illegitimate unless it can be credibly shown to achieve a public good rightly sought by the government. Officials of the state do not have legal or moral license to wield their powers capriciously or without such prior justification. This is an expression of the moral subordination of a liberal-democratic government to the citizenry which it governs.</p>

<p>Thus, opponents to the death penalty need only instill doubt that the death penalty achieves a legitimate public good in order to call for its abolishment. Just as defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty, the death penalty should be presumed unjust until proven otherwise, in particular due to the extreme severity of the sentence in relation to other sanctions, such as life imprisonment.</p>

<p>Second, most of the common arguments for the death penalty are weak. Some, like the closure and retribution arguments (which respectively argue that only execution can bring solace to the bereaved and that only death is proporitional punishment for capital crimes) fail to show that the death penalty is a necessary punishment when the leading alternative, life imprisonment, allows for later exoneration of the wrongfully convicted. This is just one respect in which capital punishment is fundamentally different from “lesser” sanctions. This is a challenge for those who would place it at a continuum of punishments of varying severity a la Beccaria.</p>

<p>Others, like the deterrence argument (which draws its justification from the potential crimes prevented by the threat of execution) succeed or fail on empirical bases: a proponent of this argument must argue that a deterrent effect actually exists. Such empirical claims are difficult to substantiate and are of little interest to me.</p>

<p>In light of these shortcomings, it seems to me that an effective argument for the the death penalty should not rely on empirical claims and should treat the death penalty uniquely, as opposed to as part of a spectrum of sanctions. Only an argument of this variety could stand against the overwhelming presumption for abolition.</p>

<p>State use of capital punishment has been in decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, a European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war- and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.</p>

<p>All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.</p>

<p>The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per-se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence and increased in subsequent years.</p>

<p>Thus, in the “developed world,” the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate and numerous cases heard at the nation’s highest court, which generally affirm that the death penalty is only to be given in cases of the most heinous capital crimes (i.e. homicide). It may not be applied to those who committed their crimes as minors, the insane, minor accomplices, and it may not be a mandatory sentence.</p>

<p>The first exponent of the abolition of the death penalty is traditionally taken to be Beccaria, whose 1790 “on crimes and punishments” proposed a radical reform of European systems of criminal justice founded on the</p>

<p>The application of the death penalty in states which retain it has been in decline throughout the 20th century. Ma</p>
