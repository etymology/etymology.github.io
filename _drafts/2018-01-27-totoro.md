This year marks the 30th anniversary of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's "My Neighbor Totoro," the film which introduced me to Ghibli, and to Japanese animation, as a child. I have fond memories of the film, and it left a strong impression on me. I spent many summer afternoons, like the protagonistic sisters Satsuki and Mei, playing outside in our garden or at the marshy border of my elementary school's play-yard, hoping to glimpse the magical realm of Totoro, indeed doing so in my vivid imagination.

On Saturday evening (1/27) I went to see the film in 35mm projection at UChicago's student-run film society, Doc Films. The theater was more crowded than for most of Doc's screenings, which tend to the obscure.

Watching Totoro on a big screen with adult eyes, I seemed to me that the film had changed dramatically since last I saw it years ago, but the laughter of first time viewers around me confirmed that it was not the film but my eyes that had changed.

From the open scenes of the idyllic sun-drenched Japanese countryside, views not surpassed until I felt a keen sense of loss. We find the Kusakabe family in transit. We aren't told why, but after having watched this film many times, it seems that they are probably relocating from the city to a countryside house closer to the hospital where Satsuki and Mei's mother is convalescing.

None of this is immediately clear: we see a grinning father and two daughters full of childish energy. Laughter and imagination are to be the tools with which all three of them cope with the move, the mother's illness, and implicitly the process of growing up.

The rickety lorry that carries the family's belongings to their new home transports 

that the idyllic sun-drenched Japanese country side could not heal.
