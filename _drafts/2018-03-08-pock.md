A claviorganum is a keyboard instrument which produces sound by means of both strings and pipes (clavier + organ = claviorganum). Although described by numerous organological treatises of the 15th and 16th centuries (Virdung, Mersenne, Praetorius etc.) they are uncommon, and were likely largely curiosities.

In practice, the string action was plectrum (a tangent action too quiet, the hammer action not yet developed) with a portative organ beneath, sometimes in the form of a table or stand. Multiple manuals, pedals, and various couplers were possible.

The instrument was praised by [cite] for its utility in accompaniment, providing the player both the piercing sound of plucked strings and the sustaining sound of organ pipes.

The article was originally published in the Osterreiches Musikzeitschrift 1976 juli/aug issue, and to the best of my knowledge is not digitally available and not translated. I hope this translation will prove of interest.
