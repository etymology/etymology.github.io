<p>When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called “Goldberg Variations,” he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording (which you can hear <a href="https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w">here</a>)</p>

<p>Even before I had listened to the recording, I was deeply skeptical and frankly doubted whether it had any artistic merit at all. In my musical circles (among them HIP musicians and recorder players) romantic interpretions of Bach are generally looked down upon as relics of a time which did not benefit from the wealth of information now readily available on the life and times of JSB, a knowledge which these musicians, paradigmatically, as essential to the tasteful, indeed to the “good” performance of this music.</p>

<p>The relationship between scholarship and performance is also unclear. Perhaps, knwoing the biographical facts of the composer’s life, his societal position and the social pressures upon him, will change our performance, but how? And why should we believe that the changes are for the better?</p>

<p>We may take it as a fact that knowledge of period performance practice was less widespread in 1970 than now, but this does not account for differences in taste. The subsequent decade would see the flourishing of CM Wein, the foundation of the AoAM, Concerto Vocale and Les Arts Florrissants: clearly HIP was in the air.</p>

<p>So here’s some of what I’ve been thinking about, which has been changing and expanding as I write.</p>

<p>One question is “How do we prepare for/perform/recognize a good ‘modern’ performance of the Goldberg variations?” With particular reference to recordings in question: Richter, Schiff, and my imaginary “mental ideal HIP” performance (because I can’t find a HIP one that I like enough to use as an example, maybe Rondeau).</p>

<p>The question is closely tied to (in the same order as trichotomy of preparation/performance/reception “is music about souls (of musicians), movements, or recordings/sonic experiences?”</p>

<p>When HIP musicians ask this question, preparation (foreknowledge of the work, its circumstances, its place in relation trends in music history and composition) is paramount to the performance, but this is a concern for performers, not for critics. As listeners to the music, we must be primarily concerned with the actual movements and sounds, not as much with the knowledge/beliefs of the performer. We should try to connect prepartion to performance (the movements) and the sound experience in order to justify different kinds of preparation on listener aesthetic grounds.</p>

<p>I wish to argue that the critical thing that makes Early Music/HIP special is that it prioritizes music as an action physically enacted by bodies, and rather than seeing the physical laws of motion that govern performance as limitations, it takes them to be principles essential to the composition of the works, and essential to their performance. Dance, the way that modies move through space, weight of the hands on keys/bows, momentum, velocity. This is a philosophy based primarily on performance. Here, the music is maybe like a transcript of motions.</p>

<p>Richter, on the other hand, prioritizes the soul, artistic inspiration over the mechanics of performance or the actual end result (he is said to have been pleased that his interpretations frequently changed). This is an essentially romantic concept of the music: the composer (and by extension, the performer) as an inspired genius channelling the ineffable. Here, music is like a platonic form or pure concept.</p>

<p>The modern post-industrial/mechanistic paradigm might by summarized as being about outcomes. What matters is consistency in the actual production of the sound, range of sounds possible to be produced. This is a philosophy of music focused on sonic outcomes. Here, music is like a sonic experience or sound recording.</p>

<p>Using this trichotomy, inqiure about Richter’s practice: in what ways does its practice fail to take into account certain factors which led to the composition of the work? One critical way: meter, physics, dance, movement of bodies is removed from the picture. Counterpoint too, as a simulation of many individual instruments, is muddied. This generates many of the things I find “unpleasant” about it.</p>

<p>Schiff, on the other hand has a strong sense of meter and counterpoint, but perhaps comes out a bit “bland” in terms of performance (the movements) in being conventionally regulated in the manner of Modern Classical post-mechanistic play.</p>

<p>Another way in which they differ is in their use of the affordances of their instrument: Richter uses few of the affordances of the harpsichord, well the only one really: note length. On the other hand, Schiff makes use of the piano color in a useful way. This also gets at the reasons why we should play on period instruments in the first place: partly it is because of the sound that they produce, but also the way in whcih the feeling of the instrument informs the play style. If, as in Richter’s case, the instrument only vaguely approximates the feelings of play and the sound, why should we think it a better instrument than, say, the hammered dulcimer, the modern piano or the (anachronistic) unfretted clavichord?</p>

<p>So which is the better “modern” performance: I argue Schiff. For his clearer projection of the physicality of the music, use of an instrument whose affordances are used to the fullest. In the ideal HIP recording, we could use a sound informed more by the feeling of play, and by physicality, the aspects of performance most critical to the interpretation.</p>
