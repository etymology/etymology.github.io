When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called "Goldberg Variations," he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's 1970 recording. (You can listen to it [here](https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w))

I was deeply skeptical. In my musical circles, the romantic interpreters of Bach (and Richter is a very late, and relatively tame one, here) are generally looked down upon as relics of a time which did not benefit from the wealth of information now readily available on the life and times of JSB.

We may take it as a fact that knowledge of period performance practice was less widespread in 1970 than now, but this does not account for differences in taste. The subsequent decade would see the flourishing of CM Wein, the foundation of the AoAM, Concerto Vocale and Les Arts Florrissants: clearly HIP was in the air.
