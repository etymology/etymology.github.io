Derek Parfit proposes the following situation in "Reasons and Persons" (1984)

> Suppose that a certain club \[meets regularly\] for several years \[then ceases to meet\]. Some years later, some of the members of this club form a club with the same name, and the same rules. We ask: ‘Have these people reconvened the very same club? Or have they merely started up another club, which is exactly similar?’ Suppose that there is no rule \[explaining how the club could be reconvened\] and that the people involved, if they asked our question, would not give it an answer.

In such a situation, according to Parfit, the question "Is this the same club?" has no answer. To use Parfit's term, the question is "empty."

Describing the "emptiness," Parfit writes

> Different answers to our question are merely different descriptions of \[the facts\]. This is why, without answering this empty question, we can know everything that there is to know. \[The answers to this question\] are not here two different possibilities, one of which must be true

Parfit then applies the idea of "empty questions" to questions of identity. For example, "What portion of my brain would have to be replaced with pieces of your brain for me to become you?" Clearly, if we replaced all of my brain with all of your brain, I would be (for all intents and purposes) you. If we were to replace only a tiny portion of my brain with a piece of yours, I would arguably still be me. (This seems no more damaging to my identity than, say, some slight brain damage.)

In the middle of this spectrum, things get murky. If I really am "me" at one end and "you" at the other, there should be some dividing line where I stop being me and start being you. Parfit arguest that while we could set such a dividing line arbitrarily (say, at 50% replacement), doing so would not tell us anything that we didn't know beforehand. We can know exactly how much brain matter was exchanged, exactly how the resultant persons will behave, and still not be able to definitively set a dividing line.

This concept, critically, appears in many areas of philosophy. To take an example from my recent reading, consider Matthew Kramer's treatment of "vague concepts" in the context of criminal law. He argues that, while we must
