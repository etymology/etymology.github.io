Derek Parfit proposes the following situation in "Reasons and Persons" (1984)

> Suppose that a certain club \[meets regularly\] for several years \[then ceases to meet\]. Some years later, some of the members of this club form a club with the same name, and the same rules. We ask: ‘Have these people reconvened the very same club? Or have they merely started up another club, which is exactly similar?’ Suppose that there is no rule \[explaining how the club could be reconvened\] and that the people involved, if they asked our question, would not give it an answer.

In such a situation, according to Parfit, the question "Is this the same club?" has no answer. To use Parfit's term, the question is "empty."

Describing the "emptiness, Parfit writes

> Different answers to our question are merely different descriptions of \[the facts\]. This is why, without answering this empty question, we can know everything that there is to know. \[The answers to this question\] are not here two different possibilities, one of which must be true

In the context of Parfit's discussion of personal identity, the concept of emptiness serves a pragmatic purpose.
