grande belleza
swedish language
swedish culture
satire is funny and has the right tone
parody of swedishness, swedish political correctness
technology and its consequences
modern art silliness
parenting
single parenting: never meet mother
casual sex and attachment
real fear, artist behaves like a monkey or a beast
publicity stunt works in the end
guy fails to apologize, gets caught up in grandeur
sense that he's not really in it
who's human here? what's going on?
children as mirrors for truth
