When I mentioned to a friend that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called "Goldberg Variations," he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's 1970 recording (which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w)).

Chronologically, it is a modern recording, but it sounds dated, and not only in the quality of the recording. Richter's recording belongs to a 

_worse_. Than modern recordings by (for example) Schiff or Frisch.

This is the claim I will be trying to justify, in only the most imagistic terms.

Richter and modernity

Why does Richter not live up to HIP standards? and thus, richter's decline

Does richter's departure from HIP practices matter? 

Compare richter to schiff
