I write as a means to think about and digest the world. My interests include musicology/organology, intellectual history, philosophy and linguistics. 

Recent lines of questioning include
* Musical performance and composition in the early modern period
* The relationship between ethics and personal identity
* Ethics, sociology and history of suicide
* History/theory of beauty

### Etymology of "Etymology"

An etymology is a lexical cosmogony. The best etymologies are surprising histories of meaning, etiologies, pathologies of the ineffable sense of words that reveal broad webs of meaning spanning time and space. So I think Etymolgoy is a fitting name for a blog that investigates reasons, conceptual networks of meaning.
