<p>The exhortation to “just be yourself” is by now a cliche of little consolation. “How am I to be ‘myself’ when I don’t know who I am?” But this question merely kicks the can down the road. The quest for the authentic self invariably leads to, and emanates from, the self questioning and confession entailed in this rejoinder.</p>

<p>While such exhortations only recently became popular wisdom, they have become so common that it is easy to forget that it relies on any non-obvious understanding of the nature of the self.</p>

<p>A quick at popular self help movements of postmodernism and their gurus reveals an obsession with the unmasking of the authentic self, already implicit in the epithet “self-help.” Oprah, Dr. Phil, Dale Carnegie, to name a few influential popular counselors, all emphasize the importance of being “true to yourself” as not only matter of personal fulfillment but also as a matter of ethics: we ought to be true to ourselves becase to being “fake” risks repression and evil behaviour. Such false people are dubbed “snakes” or “two-faced.” The obsession of reality TV with confessional revelation of the true self is also implicated in the perpetuation of this idea of the self.</p>

<p>Probably, the idea of authenticity has its roots, too, in the psychoanalytic tradition of exposing and actualizing the unconscious mind.</p>
