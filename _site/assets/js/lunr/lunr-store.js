        "excerpt":"  (1570s) a practice or trial performance of a play or other work for later public performance.The verb “to rehearse” (13c. “to repeat, give an account of”) comes from Old French “rehercier” (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. “herse” (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across plowed earth to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. Similarly, rehearsal “goes over” a work, exposing and improving it. The sense of “to practice a work for later performance” comes from the late 16th century.Compare also “hirsute” (hairy, spiny) and “hearse” (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a “herse” for its resemblance to a the farm tool. The name became metonymic for the coffin, then the vehicle.Somewhere between the practice room and the concert hall, between everyday speech and polished prose, lies a space where the tension between failure and inspiration stimulates extemporaneous performance without straining it. The performance could be a recital for friends, or a dialogue between peers.I’ll hope that this blog will be a space for such informal performances, a place to try out ideas before a forgiving (or silent) audience. Here, as in the old sense of “rehercier” I hope to comb through my thoughts, preparing them for new growth.I thank my friends for their sound advice and helpful conversations. Alhough they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, they certainly helped it come to light. Particular thanks to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure, and to Ronen for inspiring me to start. I am motivated by the thought that you might be reading.-bensource","categories": ["meta"],

        "excerpt":"When I mentioned that I’d been thinking about and playing Bach’s so called “Goldberg” variations, an recent acquaintance suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s recording, which I did. (You can listen to it here)As I considered how to tactfully say that I found the recording strange and lifeless, I got to thinking: what’s wrong with Richter anyways? In my musical circles, romantic interpreters of Bach like Richter and Furtwangler are looked down upon as relics of an age lacking in essential knowledge about the context of ancient music.But this narrative or musicological progress could fall prey to the same narrative of organological progress that argues (as did Johann Buis at a recent CSO pre-concert lecture) that the classical orchestral instruments (itself a shifting category) did not reach their full maturity until the 19th or 20th centuries.If we are to argue for, say, Schornsheim over Richter or Butt over Furtwangler","categories": ["music"],

        "title": "Empty Questions",
        "excerpt":"Derek Parfit proposes the following situation in “Reasons and Persons” (1984)  Suppose that a certain club exists for several years, holding regular meetings. The meetings then cease. Some years later, some of the members of this club form a club with the same name, and the same rules. We ask: ‘Have these people reconvened the very same club? Or have they merely started up another club, which is exactly similar?’ There might be an answer to this question. The original club might have had a rule explaining how, after such a period of non-existence, it could be reconvened. Or it might have had a rule preventing this. But suppose that there is no such rule, and no legal facts, supporting either answer to our question. And suppose that the people involved, if they asked our question, would not give it an answer. There would then be no answer to our question. The claim ‘This is the same club’ would be neither true nor false.Though there is no answer to our question, there may be nothing that we do not know. This is because the existence of a club is not separate from the existence of its members, acting together in certain ways. The continued existence of a club just involves its members having meetings, that are conducted according to the club’s rules. If we know all the facts about how people held meetings, and about the club’s rules, we know everything there is to know. This is why we would not be puzzled when we cannot answer the question, ‘Is this the very same club?’ We would not be puzzled because, even without answering this question, we can know everything about what happened. If this is true of some question, I call this question empty.When we ask an empty question, there is only one fact or outcome that we are considering. Different answers to our question are merely different descriptions of this fact or outcome. This is why, without answering this empty question, we can know everything that there is to know. In my example we can ask, ‘Is this the very same club, or is it merely another club, that is exactly similar?’ But these are not here two different possibilities, one of which must be true","categories": ["philosophy"],
