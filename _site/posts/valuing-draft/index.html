<p>Over the course of my life, I may value different things at different times, I may begin and cease to value things, and I may value only particular instances of things.</p>

<p>Consider the following case</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Years ago when I began to teach, I valued my teaching because I idealistically believed that I could make a difference. Now, I am jaded. I believe that such efforts are futile. I no longer value teaching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I began to teach, I was a person</p>

<p>The talk focused on an arguemnt arising from a theory of what it means to “value” something that led to an ostensibly repugnant conclusion. Callard called the theory the “hybrid theory of valuing.” I present the theory, which Callard asserts is commonly accpeted by those in the field, to the best of my memory.</p>

<p>On the Hybrid Theory, full fledged valuing of a thing A involves three dispositions</p>

<ol>
  <li>Belief that A is value (in a general sense)</li>
  <li>Desire for A</li>
  <li>Emotional vulnerability towards A (The nature of this disposition was not made abundantly clear, but it may not matter)</li>
</ol>

<p>In conflict with this kind of valuing are situations of “value breakdown”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Case 1: My father dies. I still value him, a fact evinced by my grief. But I fail to meet the desire requirement because I cannot desire what is impossible: I cannot desire to bring about his presence.</li>
  <li>Case 2: As a student, I strongly valued having a career in philosophy, but when I realize that there are no jobs in my AOS, I am crushed. My emotional response signals that I have a kind of value for the thing, but like how I cannot desire a dead relative, I cannot desire what I believe to be impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Callard then suggested the following exploratory line of argument.</p>

<p>In these cases, valuing is in some way defective, for our valuing of the thing in question leads us to experience mental injury. These kinds of mental injury have all the characterstics of mental illness, but they are caused by normal everyday occurrences. So we are forced to suppose that all negative emotions (or at least a large part of them) are mental illness.</p>

<p>Callard seemed to think that most would be reluctant to accept such a conclusion. I am not. It seems to me that mental illness are matters degree, not of kind. While neurotic or irrational thoughts are the characteristic of mental illnesses, they are present in all minds. We all need some fear, for example fear of being hit by cars when hit when crossing the street, in order to go on living. When these fears are overwhelming and not in accordance with the real threats, perhaps we are deeply afraid of being injured even when sitting at home alone, we call this a mental illness.</p>

<h3 id="is-value-breakdown-defective">Is value-breakdown defective?</h3>

<p>One way in which we can break the aforementioned line of reasoning is to argue that the kind of valuing in Cases 1 and 2 are not full fledged valuing. I believe that this is not necessary. In Case 1, I believe that what we mean when we say that we value</p>
