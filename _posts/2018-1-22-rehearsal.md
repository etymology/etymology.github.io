>(1570s) a practice or trial performance of a play or other work for later public performance.

The verb "to rehearse" (13c. "to repeat, give an account of") comes from Old French "rehercier" (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. "herse" (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across plowed earth to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. Similarly, rehearsal "goes over" a work, exposing and improving it. The sense of "to practice a work for later performance" comes from the late 16th century.

Compare also "hirsute" (hairy, spiny) and "hearse" (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a "herse" for its resemblance to a the farm tool. The name became metonymic for the coffin, then the vehicle.

Somewhere between the practice room and the concert hall, between everyday speech and polished prose, lies a space where the tension between failure and inspiration stimulates extemporaneous performance without straining it. The performance could be a recital for friends, or a dialogue between peers.

I'll hope that this blog will be a space for such informal performances, a place to try out ideas before a forgiving (or silent) audience. Here, as in the old sense of "rehercier" I hope to comb through my thoughts, preparing them for new growth.

I thank my friends for their sound advice and helpful conversations. Alhough they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, they certainly helped it come to light. Particular thanks to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure, and to Ronen for inspiring me to start. I am motivated by the thought that you might be reading.
