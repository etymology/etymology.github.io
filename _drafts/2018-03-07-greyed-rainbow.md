Jackson pollock's greyed rainbow is one of the art institute's most valuable single holdings, prominently displayed in late 20th century modern gallery. How shoudl we appreciate it? How do we counter arguemntsr of degeneracy? Can we extrapolate a language of art from it, and is this language expressively useful for talkign aabout other art, for example conventional or representational art?
