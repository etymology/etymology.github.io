&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You are a disembodied brain floating in a vat of nutrient fluids. This brain is connected to a supercomputer whose program produces electrical impulses that stimulate the brain in just the way that normal brains are stimulated as a result of perceiving external objects in the normal way. If you are a brain in a vat, then you have experiences that are qualitatively indistinguishable from those of a normal perceiver. If you come to believe, on the basis of your computer-induced experiences, that you are looking at at tree, then you are sadly mistaken.

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is what Agnes Callard had in mind at the informal seminar she held on 3/2 at a University of Chicago undergraduate dorm. Callard associate professor of philosophy at The University and author “Aspiration: The Agency of Becoming” (2017, OUP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began with an explanation of the Hybrid Theory of Valuing (hence H). H tries to explain what it means to value something. H aims to me a necessary and sufficient condition for “full-fledged-valuing” the disposition that we may have to our friends, or that a classical music lover may have to attending the symphony. On H, it is not enough to simply believe that classical music is valuable. According to H, valuing classical music is different from merely believing that it is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On H, full fledged valuing of a thing A involves three things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Belief that A is valuable (in a general sense)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desire for A&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emotional vulnerability towards A (The nature of this disposition was not made abundantly clear, but it may not matter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callard claimed that this description of valuing is held by most philosophers working in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of the talk was not the theory of valuing explicity, but an argument which drew reached an “undesirable” conclusion with H as a predicate. Callard presented the argument roughly as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Suppose that we hold the Hybrid Theory of Valuing, H. When we lose something or someone we value, we can no longer fulfill the second condition of H because we cannot desire what we know to be impossible (i.e. the bringing about of that which was lost). This form of valuing is also defective because it causes us pain. Nonetheless, we may sensibly say that we still value what is lost (e.g. I value my relationship with my father, now dead). But, inasmuch as this assertion opposes the truth of H, and causes us pain, it is best described as a form of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In speculation, Callard also wondered whether we could thus dub &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; negative emotions to be a form of mental illness. We can summarize the conclusions thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;C: Bereavement is a form of mental illness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;D: (strong form) all negative emotions are mental illness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callard invited us to attempt to avoid these conclusions by rejecting a premise or an argument made along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;response&quot;&gt;Response&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that C and D are both true, inasmuch as the presence of mental illness is a matter of degree rather than of kind. To use Parfit’s apt term, it is an empty question because we may know all the relevant facts about a person’s mental processes without concluding that they are “mentally ill” or “not mentally ill.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider that, even positing that levels of neurotic emotion can be directly compared between minds, the appropriate level of neuroticism is a matter of personal preference. A rational fear of being hit by cars keeps us safe cross the street. An overwhelming fear of being hit by cars might be paralyzing but we all have different tolerances for such fear and such risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for feelings of sadness or anger. Perhaps I feel that my sadness is a rational response to the iniquity of the world, that to feel otherwise would be to live ignorant of the suffering of many. Perhaps such a disposition is my preference. Labeling this extended sadness as a mental illness does not meaningfully add to our understanding of the facts involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while I believe that we should hold C and D on the aforementioned grounds, I believe that we should reject the line of reasoning which Callard presented. We should hold C and D on other grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;valuing-the-lost&quot;&gt;Valuing the lost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callard’s argument relies on a notional understanding of valuing that says that one can still value a thing that has been lost, or that is not believed to be impossible. For example, when I say that I valued my relationship with my dead father, I should be able to still value it even now. I believe that this is notionally incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to say “I value my father,” I have implied that the thing in question is ongoing: my father is persisting. If I were to say “I valued my father” we might be led to believe that my father is not longer alive, or perhaps I no longer value him because I have had some fundamental realization about him, so he no longer meets condition 1 of H.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tensed statements like these make much more sense. When we pine for the lost relative, we invoke their memory, say “would that my father were here.” We may even try to bring about the recreation of the lost thing: perhaps we fix a broken object or try a seance. These are all ways in which our value is notionally real, but they all appeal to a future potentiality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;desiring-what-is-impossible&quot;&gt;Desiring what is impossible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take issue with the desire clause 2 of H. The clear difference between the classical music concert goer and the person who believes that classical music is merely valuable in the abstract is not desire, it is the reasonable effort to bring the thing about for &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt;. The non-concert-goer does not try to bring it about for himself, but he may, out of beneficence, gift his ticket to another, so that he might enjoy the concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we believe (mistakenly) that we may bring about the resurrection of a dead relative, we may legitimately try to bring about their presence, and thus legitimately value them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we say we value them but do not try to bring about their presence, it is simply more accurate to say that we &lt;em&gt;valued&lt;/em&gt; them. More particularly, we valued our time with them, which has drawn to a close. This is notionally acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are mistaken about what is possible, we may be deceiving ourselves. Perhaps if we deceive ourselves into feeling that we may bring a dead person back to life, we are deluded. And this delusion may cause us pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;begin-deceived&quot;&gt;Begin deceived&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Plato, being deceived about the nature of the truth is one of the worst things that can happen to a man. But our priorities differ. To make a universal claim about self-deception is to make a universal claim about what matters. I probably hold mistaken beliefs about many fundamental questions, but I’m not perturbed by this. This is merely a matter of personal values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem arises from the continuity of identity over time. Take the following situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I value my friend Joe. But ever since he suffered a traumatic brain injury a year ago, he has not been himself. I no longer wish to spend time with him. In the abstract, I still love my brother but he is so changed as to make it difficult for me to believe that. Perhaps I don’t really value him at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some potential explanations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First suppose that I really do not value Joe since his accident and suppose that he did not die in the accident, that he is essentially the same person as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My opinion of Joe changed. Either his identity is the same and it was not in fact his personal identity that mattered to me, but some other extraneous aspect of his being. Or, his identity is what mattered, and I simply changed my mind about whether I valued him as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these explanations seem notionally wrong. Clearly, I valued Joe before his injury, and clearly his personal identity mattered. So we should either reject that I no longer value Joe, concluding that I do in fact value Joe. Or we should reject that Joe is the same person. I believe that we should take the latter response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case of my father’s death is similar to that of the “death” of Joe. While it may be distressing to be around Joe in his new state as a person, we should realize that what we valued was a person who is now dead. Accordingly, we can reject that we value Joe sentimentally. We should do the same for my father’s death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt that there are many objects which are really as continues as the argument of value breakdown requires. Consequently, we should feel free to reject the breakdown of value at any point in time, just as we should feel free to reject the continuous identity of objects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ben</name><email>etymology@uchicago.edu</email><uri>/about/</uri></author><category term="Valuing" /><category term="Agnes Callard" /><category term="symposium" /><summary type="html">Responding to an informal talk by Agnes Callard on valuing</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Lexical Family Tree</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/etymology-web/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Lexical Family Tree" /><published>2018-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/etymology-web</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/etymology-web/">&lt;p&gt;Etymologies, such as those provided by a Google search, sometimes provide a tree-like depiction of the various historical antecedents of a word with the headword as the root. What a tree for the entire lexicon look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-topology-of-etymology&quot;&gt;The Topology of Etymology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without actually constructing such a network, we can describe its topology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a network where each node is a “definition” of a word. If a word A is one of the most recent ancestor of B, A points to B. For example,  OFr. “hercier” would point to to “hearse” and “rehearsal.” This relation is irreflexive, as a word cannot descend from itself. Further we may forbid loops, as a word may not descend from one of its descendants. (n.b This implies that the relation is asymmetric) Thus, we can succinctly say that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Def. An &lt;em&gt;etymological network&lt;/em&gt; on a corpus C is a directed acyclic graph on a superset of C with the binary relation “”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it seems likely that there were fewer words in the ancient languages, I’m guessing that this graph will look vaguely like a polytree, with its roots being roots in the appropriate proto-language. (For English, mostly Proto-Indo-European) The graph will probably have a maximum path length of less than ten (average maximal path length probably around five) judging my my experience with the “number of steps” in most etymologies, although I would be interested to see what the maximal paths looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also interested in the connectedness of the graph. If there were two disconnected components, for example, this would tell us that there are two families of words which share no common roots or intermediaries. There are like two lexical families. It’s hard for me to say whether such lexical isolates exist. If there are minimally connected families (for example, families which share a single intermediary ancestor) what words are the bridges? These are some of the topological questions that would be answered by the construction of such a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-challenges&quot;&gt;Practical Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the necessary information is publicly available, it would be prohibitively tedious to compile it by hand. Probably better would would be to scrape it from some standardized etymology source. Unfortunately, it seems that no such source exists. Most etymologies are verbal descriptions, brief histories of words. Another problem is the resolution of conflicting etymologies, and the procuring of sources for the more difficult dead intermediary languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the tracing of the lineace of “direct” descendants and the existence of multiple concurrent versions of a word, especially before modern spelling reforms. Consider also how to take into accound the fact taht first attestatations of a word often long precede their entrance into the standard lexicon. Such a network would not capture this dynamic aspect of the lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, if we only care about investigating the general structure of such a network and restrict ourselves to a fairly small corpus of “modern” words, it should be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I proof of concept, I plan to compile such a tree by hand. I hope at some point to have time to write a script to scrape and format the data appropriately for the construction of a more substantial network.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ben</name><email>etymology@uchicago.edu</email><uri>/about/</uri></author><category term="network" /><category term="graph" /><category term="proposal" /><summary type="html">What if we tried to construct a word &quot;family tree&quot;?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have heard that Tiberius used to say that that man was ridiculous who, after sixty years, appealed to a physician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plutarch&lt;/em&gt; De Sanitate Tuenda &lt;em&gt;Vol 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[Tiberius] was wont to mock at the arts of physicians, and at those who, after thirty years of age, needed counsel as to what was good or bad for their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tacitus&lt;/em&gt; Annals &lt;em&gt;Book 6, chap 46&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presented below in context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have heard that Tiberius Caesar was wont to say, that he was a ridiculous man that held forth his hand to a physician after sixty. But it seems to me to be a little too severely said. But this is certain, that every man ought to have skill in his own pulse, for it is very different in every man; neither ought he to be ignorant of the temper of his own body, as to heat and cold, or what things do him good, and what hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plutarch&lt;/em&gt; De Tuenda Sanitate Praecepta &lt;em&gt;W.W.Goodwin trans. (1873) sec. 26&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0178%3Asection%3D26&quot;&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But even while his strength was fast failing he gave up none of his debaucheries. In his sufferings he would simulate health, and was wont to jest at the arts of the physician and at all who, after the age of thirty, require another man’s advice to distinguish between what is beneficial or hurtful to their constitutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tacitus&lt;/em&gt; Annals &lt;em&gt;Book 6, chap 46&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0078:book=6:chapter=46&amp;amp;highlight=physician&quot;&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cassell&lt;/em&gt; corroborates this account with a quotation of Suctonius (which I was unable to cross reference) that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the age of thirty, [Tiberius] ruled himself according to his own judgment wihtout the help or advice of the physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

You can find the others &lt;a href=&quot;/categories/#death-penalty&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition. In researching my position (a position which I wouldn’t defend in private conversation) I realized that the debate over state executions has far broader consequences than I had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief survey of the literature turns up many texts on the history of the death penalty and on strategies for abolition, but very few “pro death penalty” texts. In general the “academic stance” is one of opposition, and the focus of most scholarship is not even &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; we ought to eliminate the death penalty so much as &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to effect that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to use this series to compile some of the thoughts I’ve had about the death penalty. Each post will discuss an aspect of the debate: an argument, a perspective, a historical trend. Though the stance I adopted for the sake of the debate was anti-abolitionist, I am not convinced of the position. Although I personally believe that the death penalty rarely, if ever, be applied, I find the literature on abolition insufficiently self-critical, a fault which I hope to emend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before turning to philosophical arguments in later posts, I will briefly discuss practical concerns about the actual application of the death penalty in the United States. I don’t think that this evidence is enough to necessitate the abolition of the death penalty, but it may suggest a moratorium on such punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;executions-here-and-abroad&quot;&gt;Executions, Here and Abroad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State use of capital punishment has been in decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence and increased in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, in the “developed world,” the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, approval for capital punishment hovers around 50-60%. The supreme court has continued to apply ever tighter restrictions on the application of the death penalty: it may not be mandatory, it may not be applied to those who offended as minors, and may not be applied to the insane, and generally may not be applied for non-capital crimes. These rulings are in keeping with the doctrine that the death penalty is not inherently cruel and unusual, although its application should be restricted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concerns&quot;&gt;Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual implementation of the death penalty has been subject to much scrutiny, especially concerning the ostensible presence of racial bias and the costs of sentencing and execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Furman, there was a strong bias towards executing Blacks which some scholars have linked to southern cultures of lynching. Post-Furman, it is generally accepted that there is no significant racial bias on the &lt;em&gt;perpetrator’s&lt;/em&gt; race, but there is bias on the &lt;em&gt;victim’s&lt;/em&gt; race, in executions for capital crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state, in general, is more likely to execute if the victim is white than if the victim is black. This is a troubling indication that perhaps, statistically “Black Lives (don’t) Matter” when it comes to the lives of murder victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the same study shows that the total rate of execution for whites is about twice that of the rate of execution for blacks (7.8% vs 3.8%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the supreme court has ruled that while the presence of a racial bias should be rectified, it is not in itself cause to reason that the death penalty is unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The death penalty is enormously expensive in the United States, primarily due to legal costs associated with the complex capital appeals process. Nonetheless, 11% of executees post-Furman were volunteers (i.e. they waived their right to present mitigating evidence at their sentencing trial). Their legal costs are undoubtedly less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While studies on the cost of housing an inmate for life (and most are not in fact housed for the remainder of their natural lives) vary in their estimates, most agree that, as implemented and for most kinds of criminals, the costs associated with execution are greater than those of life imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-burden-of-proof&quot;&gt;The Burden of Proof&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practical concerns aside, who has the burden of proof? That is, should we presume capital punishment morally justified unless proven otherwise, or vice versa? In the absence of convincing arguments either way, what ought the state to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic principles of liberal democracies assert that the state may not invade upon the lives of its citizens unless doing so provably achieves some justly some aim which its constituents license it to seek. This manifests itself in the Principle of Minimal Invasion: the state must use the least invasive means possible to achieve its legitimate goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it would seem that it falls upon supporters of the death penalty to justify its application. In the absence of overwhelming proof, shoudl we not let live rather than kill? This presumption against teh use of force runs deep in Western liberal democracies, notwithstanding its inconsistent application. Even if this priniciple is a philosophical tenet of our democracy, skeptics of all political persuasions contend that it is improperly realized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The correct proper bounds of state power are the implicit subject of this series, the death penalty its explicit subject.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ben</name><email>etymology@uchicago.edu</email><uri>/about/</uri></author><category term="death" /><category term="politics" /><summary type="html">A brief summary of the current application of the death penalty the burden of proof</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Review: “Totoro” still moves me</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/posts/totoro/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Review: &quot;Totoro&quot; still moves me" /><published>2018-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/posts/totoro</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/posts/totoro/">&lt;p&gt;On Saturday evening (1/27) I went to see “My Neighbor Totoro” at UChicago’s student-run film society, Doc Films, in a special 30th anniversary screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totoro was my introduction to Japanese animation and I remember it fondly. Like the protagonistic sisters Satsuki and Mei, I spent summer days in the garden or the forests on the margin of the playground, hoping to catch a glimpse of Totoro or at least a rabbit or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching Totoro on a large screen made me nostalgic but confused. While I was holding back tears, first time viewers (or so I presume) were laughing around me. The incongruity confirmed to me that my eyes had changed, and the film which I had loved a child was lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The following review contains spoilers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibilities&quot;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kusakabe family (daughters Satsuki and Mei; father Tatsuo) has packed their life into an improbably laden jalopy which rattles through the Japanese countryside. We later learn that they are moving to be closer to the hospital where their mother is convalescing. The light, the children’s voices, and the waltzing score (by Hisaishi) all radiate joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tatsuo stands with his arms akimbo, beaming at their new home. Satsuki and Mei laugh as they cartwheel around the yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki seems in charge of the move: her father is well meaning but absent minded. He drops a piece of furniture. Satsuki braveyl opens the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki’s acceptance of familial responsibility is heartfelt, and never evinces resentment or questioning, in a properly Japanese manner. In spite of her young age, she is often seen to act &lt;em&gt;in loco parentis&lt;/em&gt; while her father is away, most critically when Mei goes missing for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki runs for miles looking for her, following the same roads as the moving truck did some months before. This time she is utterly alone. A farmer by the side of the road cannot help. Two passers-by on a motorcycle offer only surprise at the great distance she has just run. (This is one of those moments when I cried, others laughed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much searching, the ordeal ends in a sudden deus-ex machina. Totoro and his companions find Mei, reunite the Kusakabe family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the closing scene, the mother jokes that she wants to “spoil” the children when she comes home. They all laugh, and everything is back to normal. But how could it be? Having so lately contemplated the death of her sister and mother, how could Satsuki just “go back to normal?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-laugh-to-keep-ghosts-away&quot;&gt;“Let’s laugh to keep ghosts away”&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the beginning of the film, the girls and their father are taking a bath when a miraculously strong wind shakes the house. Their father puts on a silly faces and tells them to “laugh to keep the bogeymen away.” Their forced laughs turn to real ones as they play in the bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watched this scene I felt uncomfortable. These antics are a distraction: their emotion is forced. Laughter sublimates worry, but ultimately cannot resolve its causes. Tatsuo cannot inhabit his daughters’ world: he can only view it from the outside. He cannot air their innermost feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embodying-totoro&quot;&gt;Embodying Totoro&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki is the only member of the cast who reflects on the possibility of loss. Only she voices her concern for her mother’s health. Maybe this is why she is most in touch with the magical world of “Totoro,” who appears when loss is near at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satsuki first encounters Totoro when her father fails to return home on the bus. Totoro appears beside her, waiting for his own (cat)bus. Before departing, he gives Satusuki a package of seeds, and when her father returns moments later her excitement at meeting Totoro has washed away her worry and fatigue. Later, Totoro and company help Satsuki and Mei sprout those seeds while they sleep, “setting down roots” in their new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totoro embodies the way that imaginative play helps children to resolve worries which are beyond their capacity to express. Satsuki and Mei turn challenging situations into adventures with Totoro, allowing them to work through difficult emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teleology&quot;&gt;Teleology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this (admittedly bizarre) reading of Totoro as a sort of friendly bogeyman, an embodiment of childhood anxieties is self-indulgently autobiographical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as a more reasoned explanation, I’ll instead air some thoughts on the similarities between Totoro and Spirited Away, arguing that key themes introduced in the former are only fully explored in the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both feature a strong female protagonist (Satsuki/Chihiro) who, while in the process of moving house, enters a mystical land where her feelings of alienation and dislocation become embodied in fantastic beings (Totoro/Spirits) which she must supplicate in order to overcoming her fears and set down roots in her new home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viewed in this sense, Spirited Away is by far the more effective film. There, we feel a loneliness in Sen/Chihiro that we only glimpse in Satsuki, and the thematic material is much more evenly worked, the cast pruned to place the focus on the central drama of the heroine: Mei replaced by Chihiro’s parents, turned into pigs; the time in the spirit land akin to Tatsuo’s absence and the token character of the ailing mother is cut altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comparison suggests an indefensible teleological concept of Ghibli’s filmography. But maybe it’s an interesting supposition on this, the thirtieth anniversary of Ghibli’s most beloved film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-wrong-with-cute&quot;&gt;What’s wrong with cute?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Totoro remains popular with good reason. The luminous settings and earnest characters remind me of the magical (if perhaps totally imaginary) summers of childhood. Yet other scenes, like that of Mei sitting by solemn stone statues on a forlorn hillside in the setting sun, or of Satsuki frantically search for her sister, remain as well, unsettling me still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had hoped that Totoro would revive those childhood joys. Still charming as ever, Totoro had a different tone for me. I hope that it will be as different the next time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>ben</name><email>etymology@uchicago.edu</email><uri>/about/</uri></author><category term="review" /><category term="Doc Films" /><category term="Studio Ghibli" /><summary type="html">A favorite childhood film now feels sad.

&lt;p&gt;The verb “to rehearse” (13c. “to repeat, give an account of”) comes from Old French “rehercier” (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. “herse” (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across a plowed field to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. The modern sense comes from the late 16th century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare also “hirsute” (hairy, spiny) and “hearse” (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a “herse” for its resemblance to farm tool. The term synecdochically came to refer to the coffin and the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Think of the long trip home.
Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?
...
“Is it lack of imagination that makes us come
to imagined places, not just stay at home?
Or could Pascal have been not entirely right
about just sitting quietly in one’s room?

Continent, city, country, society:
the choice is never wide and never free.
And here, or there ... No. Should we have stayed at home,
wherever that may be?”
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– from Elizabeth Bishop, “Questions of Travel”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To a fault, my mental activity is dictated by my environment. I require distinct spaces for sleep, socialization, reflection. I’m probably not alone in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It recently occurred to me that the spaces most conducive to my creativity are liminal: spaces like the intimate recital hall, convivial dinner table, coffee shop, or reading room, which blend privacy and exposure, familiarity and novelty, in turn fostering a productive balance between contemplation and expression, reduction and synthesis. When these forces are properly balanced, my mind can spin taut conceptual webs. Too much tension and the mental filament tears. Too little and the web is formless, slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this blog will be a virtual creative space for the elaboration of my thoughts: a place to try out ideas before a forgiving audience, for mental “re-hearsal,” its content somewhere between a transcript of my internal monologue and a polished work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank my first and most forgiving audience – my friends – for their sound advice and for engaging me in helpful conversation, even when it was tedious. Although they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, it would not have come to light without their encouragement. My particular thanks go to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure and to Ronen for inspiring me to start. I am motivated by the thought that you might be reading.&lt;/p&gt;
