I write as a means to think about and digest the world. I am interested in musicology, organology, intellectual history, philosophy and linguistics.

Recent areas include
* Musical performance and composition in the early modern period
* Personal identity and ethics
* Ethics, sociology and history of suicide
* History of beauty

### Etymology of "Etymology"

An etymology is a lexical cosmogony, a history of meaning, an etiology of the sense of words that spans time and space. So I think Etymology is a fitting name for a blog that investigates reasons and networks of meaning.
