(This is the first post in a series on the death penalty. You can find the others [here](/categories/#death-penalty))

I recently spoke in a public debate on the abolition of the death penalty, arguing against abolition. The consequences of this debate are far more broad-reaching than I anticipated, and the scholarship overtly one-sided.

A brief survey of the literature on capital punishment (the death penalty, peine de mort etc. ) turns up many texts on the history of the death penalty and on strategies for abolition, but very few arguments for its continuation or application on any grounds. In general, we can say that the standard academic stance is one of general opposition, focusing not even so much on _why_ we ought to eliminate the death penalty as _how_ we can effect that goal.

Yet more frustrating is my discovery that nearly every text in support of the death penalty cites the Bible. Clearly, the Bible is an important (if not the most important) text in the Western Literary tradition. But I found it bothersome that works of argumentative analytical philosophy would use citations of sacred texts in presentation to an audience of philosophers, who are mostly skeptics at best.

Having not found a text which I felt satisfactorially addressed the issues informing the capital punishment debate, I wish to summarize some of my thoughts about the death penalty in context.

Each post in this series will treat an aspect of the debate: a popular argument, a frame through which to view the death penalty, a historical trend. This post provides an outline of the trajectory of the death penalty. 

### Capital punishment today

State use of capital punishment has been in decline in the 20th and 21th centuries. After the World Wars, a European nations successively moved to ban the use of capital punishment (for war- and peacetime offenses), sometimes as a prerequisite for becoming a member of the EU. Since 2009, the only exception has been Belarus.

All Latin American states, Canada, and 19 US states have banned the use of capital punishment in peacetime. Australia, New Zealand, and about half of the African nations have also banned it.

The United States, too, saw a nationwide hiatus in executions from 1967 to 1976 due to the 1976 ruling of Furman v. Georgia, which struck down capital punishment statutes and reduced all pending death sentences to life sentences, although it did not declare the death penalty to be unconstitutional per-se. Executions resumed following the 1977 reinstatement of the constitutionality of the death sentence and increased in subsequent years. 

Thus, in the "developed world," the 31 US states and the federal government are unusual in their retention of the death penalty, which has been a topic of heated public debate and numerous cases heard at the nation's highest court, which generally affirm that the death penalty is only to be given in cases of the most heinous capital crimes (i.e. homicide). It may not be applied to those who committed their crimes as minors, the insane, minor accomplices, and it may not be a mandatory sentence.

### Abolition

The first exponent of the abolition of the death penalty is traditionally taken to be Beccaria, whose 1790 "on crimes and punishments" proposed a radical reform of European systems of criminal justice founded on the idea that there should be a continuum of punishments in proportion to the continuum of crimes. His opposition to the death penalty, however, seems to be that it was simply not as effective in scaring off criminals as life imprisonment, a cruel fate for prisoners of the 19th century.

Modern day abolition movements began after the world wars. In many countries, the move for abolition took on a politcal bent, with the issue being viewed as one of human rights.

In the United States, approval for capital punishment hovers between 50-60%. Despite the de-facto moratorium on executions from 1967-1976, the executions continue and the supreme court continues to apply ever tighter restrictions to the application of the death penalty: it may not be mandatory, it may not be applied to those who offended as minors, and may not be applied to the insane, and generally may not be applied for non-capital crimes. These rulings are in keeping with the doctrine that the death penalty is not inherently cruel and unusual, although its application should be restricted.

The death penalty is enormously expensive in the United States, primarily due to legal costs associated with the complex capital appeals process. Nonetheless, 11% of executees post-Furman were volunteers (i.e. they waived their right to present mitigating evidence at their sentencing trial).

This brief disjointed summary will have to suffice, as I am not primarily interested in statistics. I will sidestep those questions and turn to philosophical problems related to the death penalty in subsequent posts in this series.
