When I mentioned to a friend that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called "Goldberg Variations," he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's 1970 recording (which you can listen to [here](https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w)). Here is a partial attempt to explain the recording and my reactions to it.

Richter's performance izz. Although he plays a harpsichord instead of a piano, his instrument does not resemble those available to Bach at the time and place of composition (ca. 1735-1740, Leipzig), and many of his interpretive choices (tempi, rubato, accents) differ significantly from those made by modern HIP performances. 

A complete etiology and analysis of Richter's style and his relation to the HIP movement, which flourished commercially and artistically in the decade following this recording, is a project for another time. Instead, I'll discuss two aspects of the recording which I feel best explain my initial reactions: the instrument used, and the sense of time, or meter.

### On affordances

The harpsichord is large and loud. I do not have a source for its make or disposition but I seems to have (in addition to the normal 8' choirs) 16', 4' nasard and buff. Following Williams, Bach's was nation whose "first keyboard-love was the organ, and whose harpsichords were either simple work-horses or elaborate pseudo-organs." Clearly Richter's instrument falls into the latter category, although its disposition is not comparable to any German keyboard instruments from the period of composition, ca. 1735-40.

It is altogether fitting to call Richter's instrument a "psuedo-organ" because Richter was an organist, and plays like one. While he use sthe

Although this "pseudo-organ" suits Richter, first an organist, Richter's use of disposition to creat color contrasts feels foreign to the contrapunctal writing of the Goldbergs. While he makes use of the registrational possibilities, Richter's touch is heavy and insensitive.

I believe that this is more than simply a difference of taste: it is also a matter of the most effective use of the instrument's affordances. The harpsichord, like the organ, has
