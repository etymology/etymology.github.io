<p>(This post is one of a series on the death penalty. You can find the others <a href="/categories/#death-penalty">here</a>)</p>

<p>The basic question is</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>When may the state execute?
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where we define an “execution” as</p>
<ol>
  <li>a state killing</li>
  <li>under the deliberative rule of a criminal justice system (not extrajudicial, non-accidental)</li>
</ol>

<p>This post will reflect on the first premise.</p>

<p>Some associated questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the state?</li>
  <li>What is do we mean by “killing?”</li>
  <li>Who is being killed?</li>
  <li>On what grounds?</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, the answers to first three questions are something like</p>
<ol>
  <li>Liberal democracies</li>
  <li>Lethal injection, hanging</li>
  <li>Individuals who are believed to have committed heinous crimes</li>
</ol>

<p>The fourth question is normative, not descriptive. Intuitively, we may</p>

<p>It is a fact that states kill. most now also use softer tools to control human life: welfare, regulation, indoctrination, in the manner of a Foucauldian “bio-power” which is now involved in “fostering/letting die” as well as “killing/clemency. One way to view this shift is as a move towards “lesser invasion” inasmuch as killing is the ultimate bodily invasion. In light of this, the burden of proof seems to be on advocates of the death penalty, to demonstrate why no less invasive measure serves the same public aim. Already apparent is the relationship between the death penalty and the theory of sovereignty, which I will take up in a later post.</p>
