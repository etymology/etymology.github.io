<p>I recently spoke in a debate on the motion “people have a right to die,” arguing that people have a right to die, along with a collection of other moral and political views. I don’t think that I sufficiently addressed the other debaters’ arguments, and I feel that my view was incoherent. Indeed, it was largely improvised. So I wish to try again, summarizing the arguments of the other debaters and formulating my own, more coherent, view.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this was really a debate on assisted suicide and other forms of killing. I believe that “right to die” is merely a euphemism, not a fundamentally deep question whose answer will reveal something about the nature of what is right or good. We should care about whether we act rightly, and whether society is organized in the best possible way. While we may try to answer these questions in the framework of rights. Rights are simply a terminology with which we try to answer these fundamental ethical and political questions. In order to avoid misunderstanding, we should approach the these questions head on, addressing what really matters without preconceptions.</p>

<p>The two speakers who argued that people don’t/shouldn’t have a right to die presented a single coherent view so I’ll address their arguments together. My partner and I had differing views so I describe his separately.</p>

<p>I don’t have a recording of the debate, but I have tried to represent all arguments to the best of my memory, and with the greatest charity. I will respond to these arguments with my own, revised, arguments.</p>

<h3 id="against-a-right-to-die-students-for-life">Against a right to die: Students for Life</h3>

<p>Is it wrong to commit suicide? On this, the anti-legalization side conceded that an argument in favor of the immorality of suicide might require the existence of a higher power.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they argue societal acknowledgment of the right to die shows a lack of appreciation for the value of persons, treating them merely for their utility. Consider the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice is severely disabled and is suffering. She reasons “I an no longer useful. My life is not worth living as it adds nothing to the collective good. In fact, I may be a drain upon total well-being of society. So I should end my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the members of Students for Life (SfL), societal recognition (de facto or de jure legalization, constitutional enshrinement of such a right e.g.) of assisted suicide would legitimize Alice’s reasoning. Such reasoning, they argue, displays a fundamental lack of appreciation for human life. It treats human life as a mere means to collective good, rather than as an end in itself. No one would like to live in such a society. We should value all human life, and instead Alice to end her own life, we should try to relieve her suffering.</p>

<p>On the more controversial of non-voluntary euthanasia, they proposed the following situations. One involves the euthanasia of a mentally incompetent but resistant patient. I believe that this is an indefensible action so I will not address it. Another case is that of a patient in a persistent vegetative state who is disconnected from life support by his family members or doctors. They asserted that such a case differs morally from, say, lethal injection, but did not specify how.</p>

<p>Additionally, they cast doubt on the idea that suicide can be rational, even in cases where the future seems bleak. I do not know what my future holds, so how do I know that death will be better than the alternative? They again contended that in the the face of such doubt, we should try alleviate suffering rather than end life.</p>

<h3 id="for-a-right-to-die-my-partner">For a right to die: My partner</h3>

<p>My partner’s view was reminiscent of Locke or Mill. We own our bodies (cf. Locke) and thus may dispose of them as we please, as we would our other possessions, as long as we don’t harm others in the process (cf. Mill). This self-ownership constitutes the right to suicide.</p>

<p>He emphasized that assisted suicide is not really a choice to die, as we will all die some day. It is most accurately described as a matter of deciding <em>when</em> to die. If we utilitarians (either universally or egoistically) we may believe that if we are certain to suffer immensely if we continue to live, we may prefer not to live at all. Furthermore, if we are universal utilitarians, we may believe that the ending of these people’s lives would be better for everyone, so long as they die by their own volition.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-disagree">How do we disagree?</h3>

<p>Both of the aforementioned views are incomplete, as would be any view on the issue as articulated in a ten minute speech, further re-articulated in summary. However, even under the most charitable extension and explanation, I believe  both views face significant structural problems, problems which lie at the core issues of ethics and politics. This is what makes the issue of assisted suicide so fruitful.</p>

<p>I think that the debaters agreement was more than they explicitly acknowledged. I think that their disagreement largely consists in misunderstanding of the nature of the entities at hand: the state, the person, and rights (for rights are things, albeit metaphysical). Thus, my response will consist largely in describing the necessary properties of those entities under each view, examining the consequences of those properties, and presenting a more accurate view.</p>

<p>In addition, I think that the debate did not consider some of the most critical aspects of the debate, such as the distinction between suicide and assisted for both the party assisting and the part dying, the moral significance of intention in such situations, and the nature of rationality.I don’t think that the omission of these important topics as intended to deceive. These difficult topics may</p>

<h4 id="rights">Rights</h4>

<p>As I reiterated during the debate, I feel that it is misleading to frame the issue of assisted suicide with the concept of the framing of “rights.” Without explicit recognition, each side used a different idea of rights. Rather than try to resolve this difference in favor of any single view, I believe that we should set aside the concept altogether.</p>

<p>Rights give us duties and responsibilities. Property rights, for example, invoke a bundle of duties imposed upon others regarding what they may do to another’s property. You may not, without my permission, use, destroy, modify etc. my property. But these rights may be overridden. Suppose that I use my car to block your driveway. By using my car to hinder your legitimate use of your driveway, I forfeit some of the rights which I have over my car in other spaces.</p>

<p>Some people believe that there are rights which may not be overridden, such as the right to life. Perhaps such rights exist but the right to life is regularly forfeited, and is thus not among them. For example, if I attack you it is reasonable to suppose that you might act in self defense and harm or kill me. Criminals, enemy combatants, casualties of war may all be legitimately killed by the state.</p>

<p>What matters in all of these cases is not rights <em>qua</em> rights, but rather the obligations that rights entail. The system of rights proposes that there is a property invariant among people (rights) that entails certain duties, and such a system is only as good as it correctly describes and explains the duties that we have towards one another and to ourselves.</p>

<p>But as we have seen above, the system of rights hardly provides the invariant we are looking for. While they do capture an aspect of common-sense belief about what is right and wrong, their explanatory power is weakened because they are not truly invariant. A system with many exceptions is not systemic, unless the exceptions them are systematic. And if the exceptions are systematic, we should try to understand why.</p>

<p>Rather we should directly ask about reasons, beliefs and facts without presuming that the framework of rights is the best reductive explanatory line of inquiry.</p>

<p>Regarding assisted suicide, we should try to answer the following questions:</p>

<p>Moral questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill oneself?</li>
  <li>When is it rational to kill oneself?</li>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill a person with their ongoing consent?</li>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill an incompetent person with their prior consent?</li>
  <li>When is it morally permissible to kill an person with their consent?</li>
</ul>

<p>Political questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When should suicide be legal?</li>
  <li>When should assisted suicide be legal?</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe that the views summarized above fail to satisfactorily address some or all of the questions above, or fail for structural reasons.</p>

<h4 id="the-norm-argument">The “norm” argument</h4>

<p>Suppose that we grant that rights (at least in some limited sense) societal norms that indicate values that we legally uphold and reflect societal attitudes. SfL concluded that acknowledging a right to assisted suicide shows a disregard for human life, and no person would want to live in a society that disregarded human life.</p>

<p>Setting aside for a moment whether legal acknowledgement of assisted suicide does in fact display a regard for humanity, we can question whether it is necessarily so. And whether it would be better if we had some other disposition with towards assisted suicide. Consider the following example (based on the actual Fore people of Papua New Guinea)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fore people believed that the proper way to show respect for their dead was to eat their brains. They say “Burying and burning are for garbage! Interring or cremating our dead would be treating them like mere trash. We should treasure their souls by eating their brains.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>But they learned that cannibalism (especially of brains) transmits the incurable neurodegenerative disease called Kuru, killing hundreds every year. So they changed their customs. Some were at first uncomfortable with the idea of burying their dead, but they found it acceptable if it alleviated the suffering caused by the Kuru disease. Over time their customs changed, and now suffers slow mental decline and death from Kuru.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the example of the Fore illustrates, societal attitudes towards what an action says about a person or a society are contingent. It is not necessary that we hold the attitude that assisted suicide reveals lack of care about human life just as cannibalism is not necessary to show respect for the dead. Indeed societal norms have often been revised in our own society.</p>

<p>Perhaps our societal attitudes towards assisted suicide are like the Fore people’s attitudes towards cannibalism. Just as the suffering from Kuru justified a changed in the Fore people’s values and funerary practices, perhaps end of life suffering justifies a change in our society attitudes.</p>

<p>Just as the Fore did not <em>think</em> that they would want to live in a society that did not cannibalize its dead because such a society did not show sufficient ancestral respect, we might not <em>think</em> we’d want to live in a society that legitimizes assisted suicide. And just as the Fore changed their minds once they learned that there were other morally significant matters at stake, we may have good reason to change our minds about assisted suicide.</p>

<p>Thus, the norm argument can be defensibly denied. It remains an open question whether assisted suicide would in fact provide societal benefits, a situation which is not as clear as the causation of cannibalism and Kuru. But it is clear that our attitude towards assisted suicide are not what matters. We should be open to changing our attitude just as the Fore people changed their attitude towards cannibalism.</p>

<h4 id="autonomy-and-utilitarianism-in-conflict">Autonomy and Utilitarianism in Conflict</h4>

<p>My partner, arguing for the right to die, drew both on self-determination and utilitarianism to justify assisted suicide. But I believe that these two ideas are in conflict with each other. We may not be true utilitarians and also hold a Lockean view of total self-ownership.</p>

<p>Suppose that we hold that people may do whatever they please with their bodies and property, the right which also legitimizes suicide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love smoked ham, so I build a smoker in my backyard. But the smoke wafts over the boundaries of my property and annoys many neighbors, but not appreciably to any great extent. But when my neighbors see my smoker, they decide to buy one too. Soon the smog is unbearable for all, although the effect of any single one is insignificant.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="why-not-regulate">Why not regulate?</h4>

<h4 id="rationality-of-suicide">Rationality of suicide</h4>

<p>All parties of the debate considered the question of whether suicide can be rational. This matters because irrationality is often used as justification for paternalism. If we are paternalists with regard to irrationality, we should act to prevent people from committing irrational suicides.</p>

<p>So independent of the justification of paternalism, we may wish to argue for suicide’s rationality/irrational.</p>

<h4 id="utility-and-human-dignity">Utility and human dignity</h4>

<p>SfL also argued that utilitarianism treats people as mere means. When people are no longer useful to society, they should be killed or kill themselves. I believe that this version of utilitarianism is too easy a target. We can simply revise our utility function to include preference satisfaction.</p>

<p>Utility as preference satisfaction suffers from well known problems such as the “utility monster,” a person who derives immense utility from killing others, such that the utility reaped by doing so outweighs any negative effects on his victims and their families.</p>

<p>Nonetheless,</p>

<h4 id="persons">Persons</h4>

<h4 id="politics">Politics</h4>

<p>On SfL’s view, rights are like societal norms. If we hold that “it would be better of most people in our society believed that people ought not to kill themselves” or “it would be better if most people in our society believed that they should not take innocent human lives” then our government should not enshrine the right to die, as it would cause more people to be of this disposition, which would be bad.</p>

<p>These notions of rights miss an essential feature of a right which is that it imposes duties or constraints on our actions. When we say that</p>

<p>Still, though, these questions skirt around what seem to me the most important questions of the issue</p>

<p>This case, of letting die, they argued is different from assisted suicide.</p>
