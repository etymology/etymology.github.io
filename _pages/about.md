I write to think about what I read/hear/see/taste etc. My interests include musicology/organology, intellectual history, philosophy and linguistics.

Lately, I've been reading about

* Music
    - The HIP movement
    - Reuse and reconstruction in Bach
    - Dance-music interrelation in turn of the 18th century France
* Ethics
    - Authenticity, personal expression and ethics
    - Personal identity to ethics (_Reasons and Persons_)
    - Meta-ethical claims of _On What Matters_
    - Ethics of sexual consent in philosophy and the law
* Aesthetics
    - Sound languages and aesthetic systems, esp. re. HIP
    - Aesthetic principles of Islamic art, esp. calligraphy
