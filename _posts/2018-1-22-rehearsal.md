>(1570s) a practice or trial performance of a play or other work for later public performance.

The verb "to rehearse" (13c. "to repeat, give an account of") comes from Old French "rehercier" (to go over again, repeat) which in turn derives from OFr. "herse" (harrow), a rake like implement which is dragged across a plowed field to break up clods, remove weeds, and cover seeds. The modern sense comes from the late 16th century.

Compare also "hirsute" (hairy, spiny) and "hearse" (a funeral coach), originally a wood or metal framework which held the mortuary cloth over the bier or coffin, called a "herse" for its resemblance to a the farm tool. The name became metonymic for the coffin and the vehicle.

Somewhere between the practice room and the concert hall lies a space where the tension between failure and inspiration stimulates unstrained extemporaneous performance. These performances could be intimate recitals, or dialogues between friends.

I hope that this blog will be a space for such informal performances, a place to try out ideas before a forgiving audience, a "re-hearsal" of my mental field, turning over my thoughts in preparation for further growth.

I thank my friends for their sound advice and helpful conversation. Alhough they are not to blame for this (mis)adventure, they helped it come to light. Particular thanks to Emily for arguing that this blog could achieve something more than indecent academic exposure, and to Ronen for inspiring me to start. I am motivated by the thought that you might be reading.
