I read and write, but not nearly as much as I ought to. My interests include, musicology, organology, intellectual history, aesthetics, political and ethical philosophy, and linguistics.

Lately, I've been thinking lately about

* The Historically Informed Performance movement
* Personal authenticity as an ethical ideal
* The ethics of suicide and non-birth
* Principles of valid (sexual) consent
* Parfit's theories of personal identity and ethics
* Aesthetics of Islamic art
