<p>When I mentioned to an acquaintance that I’d been thinking about J.S. Bach’s “Goldberg” variations he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording, which I did. (You can listen to it <a href="https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w">here</a>)</p>

<p>The instrument sounds like a modern revival harpsichord equipped with 16’, 4’, nasard, buff, which Richter uses in all combinations, often changing registration on the (not always observed) repeats, sometimes even within phrases. His touch is organistic, his tempi mostly plausible but momentarily uneven, and with little sense of meter or momentum. Color subordinates counterpoint and linear structure. Each variation becomes a <em>pièce de caractère</em>. (A <em>pièce richtère</em>?)</p>

<p>Stranger than recording is the comments section (O anomic haven for the disenfranchised!), full of panegyrics (and a few poorly aimed invectives) from armchair critics wielding preference as a token of refinement. “Very serious and not easy-listening” writes one. This practice of virtue-signalling takes on another form “HIP connoisseur” who savors “rare” music as a sign of discrimination.</p>

<p>How did have such a high opinion of a recording which would never sell today? Perhaps they, from outside the HIP bubble, heard it in a way that I could not. To give them the benefit of the doubt, I resolved to think more on the question of Richter’s aesthetics.</p>

<h3 id="stakes">Stakes</h3>

<p>The recording in question was made at the beginning of the decade which saw the flourishing of CM Wein and the foundation of such groups as the AoAM, Concerto Vocale, and Les Arts Florissants. In short, the success in earnest of the period-instrument/HIP movement. In reevaluating Richter, we are also reevaluating HIP’s ascent, and its aesthetic principles.</p>

<p>We begin from the perspective of skepticism: sketicism that the</p>

<p>At least, we must explain why our tastes have changed.</p>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>The consensus in my musical circles (the ones that care for Bach, at least) is that romantic performances of Bach (and Richter’s is a very late and relatively inoffensive one) are products of an age lacking in essential knowledge about the context of ancient music, and hence lacking in essential merit.</p>

<p>I take it as fact that today’s esteemed scholar/performers know more about the life and times of JSB than Richter – some documents had not been brought to light at the time – but this fact is not an etiology.</p>

<p>Even those performers that who take the (neo-platonic?) view that, <em>ex-ante</em>, the informed performance is the better one should concede that the question of Richter’s popularity (or rejection) is a question of aesthetics and recordings, not of virtues and musicians. We do not, in principle, care whether Richter <em>acted rightly</em>, rather we should care that the recording is <em>good</em> or <em>beautiful</em>, as we experience it, and try to understand it on its terms and our own.</p>

<p>As musicians know, the well-informed are not always the best performers: the proof must be in the execution, and we cannot close this aesthetic argument with a summary of the player’s beliefs and values.</p>

<h3 id="suspicion">Suspicion</h3>

<p>One reason why the quasi-scientific narrative of “learned performance is better performance” bothers me is because it bears a troubling resemblance to the teleological “establishment classical” reading of organology (advanced by a recent CSO pre-concert lecture) that asserts that the orchestral instruments did not fully mature until the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By this argument, the broader compasses, dynamic ranges, and (a)tonalities which are easily producible with modern instruments makes then better tools for the job. But, to parody the HIP stance, what is a learned mind but a better tool?</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>In the sense that  both the EM and establishment camps have a teleological argument for their “modern” performance practice.</p>

<p>Only HIP (pace Butt, Haynes) is a kind of modish modernism that asserts that it has fully integrated all cultures, past and present, freeing itself from the shackles of the institution.</p>

<h3 id="reading-richter">Reading Richter</h3>

<p>But where does that leave Richter?</p>

<p>Performing on a harpsichord in a style</p>

<p>Perhaps the HIP moment was borne out of a reactionary nostalgia for an irrecoverable moment when western musical culture was monolithic and tasteful. Worse, perhaps it was a commercially successful reactionary movement.</p>

<p>The artist, free from the confines of capital, is a romantic idea. We need only look to the published and dedicated outputs of any working composer/musician of the early modern period for evidence that art-for-pay is as old as pay itself, only the transactors have changed. The dedicatee of the “Brandenburgs” was Margrave. The “dedicatee” of the modern concert performance is the LCD concert-goer who will not to pay to hear more adventurous early-music.</p>

<p>Besides being commercially and musically of fashion among  teleological view of musical/organological.</p>

<p>The fact that HIP has enjoyed such commercial success is no less discomforting. Adorno’s critique of HIP as a “culture of restoration”</p>

<p>not the least bit because of how deeply enmeshed I am in communities of historical performance.</p>

<p>When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called “Goldberg Variations,” he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter’s 1970 recording (which you can hear <a href="https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w">here</a>)</p>

<p>Even before I had listened to the recording, I was deeply skeptical and frankly doubted whether it had any artistic merit at all. In my musical circles (among them HIP musicians and recorder players) romantic interpretions of Bach are generally looked down upon as relics of a time which did not benefit from the wealth of information now readily available on the life and times of JSB, a knowledge which these musicians, paradigmatically, as essential to the tasteful, indeed to the “good” performance of this music.</p>

<p>The relationship between scholarship and performance is also unclear. Perhaps, knwoing the biographical facts of the composer’s life, his societal position and the social pressures upon him, will change our performance, but how? And why should we believe that the changes are for the better?</p>

<p>We may take it as a fact that knowledge of period performance practice was less widespread in 1970 than now, but this does not account for differences in taste. The subsequent decade would see the flourishing of CM Wein, the foundation of the AoAM, Concerto Vocale and Les Arts Florrissants: clearly HIP was in the air.</p>

<h3 id="richter-and-schiff">Richter and Schiff</h3>

<p>So here’s some of what I’ve been thinking about, which has been changing and expanding as I write.</p>

<p>One question is “How do we prepare for/perform/recognize a good ‘modern’ performance of the Goldberg variations?” With particular reference to recordings in question: Richter, Schiff, and my imaginary “mental ideal HIP” performance (because I can’t find a HIP one that I like enough to use as an example, maybe Rondeau).</p>

<p>The question is closely tied to (in the same order as trichotomy of preparation/performance/reception “is music about souls (of musicians), movements, or recordings/sonic experiences?”</p>

<p>When HIP musicians ask this question, preparation (foreknowledge of the work, its circumstances, its place in relation trends in music history and composition) is paramount to the performance, but this is a concern for performers, not for critics. As listeners to the music, we must be primarily concerned with the actual movements and sounds, not as much with the knowledge/beliefs of the performer. We should try to connect prepartion to performance (the movements) and the sound experience in order to justify different kinds of preparation on listener aesthetic grounds.</p>

<p>I wish to argue that the critical thing that makes Early Music/HIP special is that it prioritizes music as an action physically enacted by bodies, and rather than seeing the physical laws of motion that govern performance as limitations, it takes them to be principles essential to the composition of the works, and essential to their performance. Dance, the way that modies move through space, weight of the hands on keys/bows, momentum, velocity. This is a philosophy based primarily on performance. Here, the music is maybe like a transcript of motions.</p>

<p>Richter, on the other hand, prioritizes the soul, artistic inspiration over the mechanics of performance or the actual end result (he is said to have been pleased that his interpretations frequently changed). This is an essentially romantic concept of the music: the composer (and by extension, the performer) as an inspired genius channelling the ineffable. Here, music is like a platonic form or pure concept.</p>

<p>The modern post-industrial/mechanistic paradigm might by summarized as being about outcomes. What matters is consistency in the actual production of the sound, range of sounds possible to be produced. This is a philosophy of music focused on sonic outcomes. Here, music is like a sonic experience or sound recording.</p>

<p>Using this trichotomy, inqiure about Richter’s practice: in what ways does its practice fail to take into account certain factors which led to the composition of the work? One critical way: meter, physics, dance, movement of bodies is removed from the picture. Counterpoint too, as a simulation of many individual instruments, is muddied. This generates many of the things I find “unpleasant” about it.</p>

<p>Schiff, on the other hand has a strong sense of meter and counterpoint, but perhaps comes out a bit “bland” in terms of performance (the movements) in being conventionally regulated in the manner of Modern Classical post-mechanistic play.</p>

<p>Another way in which they differ is in their use of the affordances of their instrument: Richter uses few of the affordances of the harpsichord, well the only one really: note length. On the other hand, Schiff makes use of the piano color in a useful way. This also gets at the reasons why we should play on period instruments in the first place: partly it is because of the sound that they produce, but also the way in whcih the feeling of the instrument informs the play style. If, as in Richter’s case, the instrument only vaguely approximates the feelings of play and the sound, why should we think it a better instrument than, say, the hammered dulcimer, the modern piano or the (anachronistic) unfretted clavichord?</p>

<p>So which is the better “modern” performance: I argue Schiff. For his clearer projection of the physicality of the music, use of an instrument whose affordances are used to the fullest. In the ideal HIP recording, we could use a sound informed more by the feeling of play, and by physicality, the aspects of performance most critical to the interpretation.</p>

<hr />

<p>Intuitively, I disliked the recording. But in trying to explain my reaction to it, I was reminded that questions of taste are, contrary to the common saying, much to be disputed.</p>

<p>I may devote another post(s) to further quesitons on musical aesthetics, but for the sake of brevity, I will here focus on a single aspect of the Richter’s recording: timing.</p>

<h3 id="notating-time">Notating time</h3>

<p>Scores direct a musician to place notes in time, but the notation (especially considering the sparse notition of BWV 988 and its type) is imprecise. Among generalities, we can notes of the same value should have roughly the same duration. Some notes should occur simultaneously, some not. Perhaps a “staccato” dotted eight with a sixteenth followed by a sixteenth rest or similar.</p>

<p>But beyond the general outlines of how decisions like the interpretation of “slur” marks, the setting of a general “tempo,” the use of rubato (even, seemingly, the definition of the term), and the</p>
