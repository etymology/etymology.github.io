<p>I recently spoke in a debate on the motion “people have a right to die,” arguing that people have a right to die, along with a collection of other moral and political views. I don’t think that I sufficiently addressed the other debaters’ arguments, and I feel that my view was inconherent. Indeed, it was largely improvised. So I wish to try again, summarizing the arguments which others presented and formulating my own, more coherent, view.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this was really a debate on assisted suicide and other forms of killing. I believe that “right to die” is merely a euphemism, not a fundamentally deep question whose answer will reveal something about the nature of what is right or good. We should care about whether we act rightly, and whether society is organized in the best possible way. While we may try to answer these questions in the framework of rights. Rights are simply a terminiology with which we try to answer these fundamental ethical and political questions. In order to avoid misunderstanding, we should approach the these questions head on, addressing what really matters without preconceptions.</p>

<p>The two speakers who argued that people don’t/shouldn’t have a right to die presented a single coherent view so I’ll address their arguments together. My partner and I had differing views so I describe his separately.</p>

<p>I don’t have a recording of the debate, but I have tried to represent all arguments to the best of my memory, and with the greatest charity. I will respond to these arguments with my own, revised, arguments.</p>

<h3 id="against-a-right-to-die-students-for-life">Against a right to die: Students for Life</h3>

<p>Is it wrong to commit suicide? On this, the anti-legalization side conceded that an argument in favor of the immorality of suicide might require the existence of a higher power.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, they argue societal acknowledgment of the right to die shows a lack of appreciation for the value of persons, treating them merely for their utility. Consider the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Alice is severely disabled and is suffering. She reasons “I an no longer useful. My life is not worth living as it adds nothing to the collective good. In fact, I may be a drain upon total well-being of society. So I should end my life.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to SfL, societal recognition (de facto or de jure legalization, enshrinement of such a right e.g.) of assisted suicide would legitimize reasoning like Alice’s. Such reasoning, they argue, displays a fundamental lack of appreciation for human life. It treats human life as a mere means to collective good, rather than as an end in itself. No one would like to live in such a society. We should value all human life, and instead of authorizing people like Alice to end their own lives, we should try to relieve their suffering.</p>

<p>On the more controversial of non-voluntary euthanasia, they proposed the following sitatuations. One involves the euthanasia of a mentally incomepente but resistant patient. I believe that this is an indefensible action. Another case involves the distinction between killing and letting die.</p>

<p>Additionally, they sought to cast doubt on the idea that suicide could ever be rational, even in cases where the future seems bleak. I do not know what my future holds, so how do I know that death is better than the alternative? They contended that it would be better to try to ameliorate the causes of discomfort rather than end life.</p>

<h3 id="for-a-right-to-die-my-partner">For a right to die: My partner</h3>

<p>My partner’s view was reminiscent of Locke or Mill. We own our bodies (cf. Locke) and thus may dispose of them as we please, as we would our other possessions, as long as we don’t harm others in the process (cf. Mill). This self-ownership constitutes the right to suicide.</p>

<p>He emphasized that assisted suicide is not really a choice to die, as we will all die some day. It is most accurately described as a matter of deciding <em>when</em> to die. If we utilitarians (either universally or egoistically) we may believe that if we are certain to suffer immensely if we continue to live, we may prefer not to live at all. Furthermore, if we are universal utilitarians, we may believe that the ending of these people’s lives would be better for everyone, so long as they die by their own volition.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-disagree">How do we disagree?</h3>

<p>Both of the aforementioned views are incomplete, as would be any view on the issue as articulated in a ten minute speech, further rearticulated in summary. However, even under the most charitable extension and explanation, I believe  both views face significant structural problems, problems which lie at the core issues of ethics and politics. This is what makes the issue of assisted suicide so fruitful.</p>

<p>I think that the debaters agreement was more than they explicitly acknowleged. I think that their disagreement largely consists in mutual misunderstanding of the nature of the entities at hand: the state, the person, and rights (for rights are things, albeit metaphysical). Thus, my response will consist largely in describing the necessary properties of those entities under each view, examining the consequences of those properties, and presenting a mroe accurate view.</p>

<h4 id="rights">Rights</h4>

<p>As I reiterated during the debate, I feel that the framing of this question around “rights” is misleading. Without explicit recognition, both sides used different conceptions of rights. Rights are things that give us duties and responsibilities. For example, property rights encompass a broad set of duties imposed upon others regarding what they may and may not do to my property. You may not, without my permission, use, destroy, modify etc. my property. These are just some of the common constraints of property.</p>

<p>But these rights are supravenable. Suppose that I use my car to block your driveway. It wouls seem that I am not within my rights to ask that you not move my car.</p>

<p>Some people believe that there are rights which are not supravenable, such as the right to life. Nonetheless, even the right to life is regularly forefeited. For example, if I attack you it is reasonable to suppose that you might act in self defense and harm or kill me. Criminals, enemy combatants, casualties of war may all be legitimately killed.</p>

<p>Although it is common to say that people have rights and thus we have responsibilities, it seems that rights are so easily and commonly overrided, so easily misunderstood, and too intuitively powerful to serve as the basis for a clear headed discussion of the issues at hand.</p>

<p>The recognition of a right to die involves answers to the following questions:</p>

<p>Moral questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is it ever morally permissible to kill oneself?</li>
  <li>Is it ever rational to kill oneself?</li>
  <li>Is it ever morally permissible to kill a competent with their ongoing consent?</li>
  <li>Is it ever morally permissible to kill an incompetent person with their prior consent?</li>
</ul>

<p>Political questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Should suicide be legal?</li>
  <li>Should assisting suicide be legal? Under what terms?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="persons">Persons</h4>

<h4 id="politics">Politics</h4>

<p>On SfL’s view, rights are like societal norms. If we hold that “it would be better of most people in our society believed that people ought not to kill themselves” or “it would be better if most people in our society believed that they should not take innocent human lives” then our government should not enshrine the right to die, as it would cause more people to be of this disposition, which would be bad.</p>

<p>These notions of rights miss an essential feature of a right which is that it imposes duties or constraints on our actions. When we say that</p>

<p>Still, though, these questions skirt around what seem to me the most important questions of the issue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bob has entered a persistent vegetative state after suffering a stroke. His doctors believe that he will not regain consciousness. They judge, correctly, that without continual life-support he will perish quickly. They decide to cease life support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This case, of letting die, they argued is different from assisted suicide.</p>
