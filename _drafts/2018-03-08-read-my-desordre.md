The UChicago Presents 2017-18 concert season's Ligeti series culminated this week with Pierre-Laurent Aimard's concert of Ligeti and Beethoven (3/6) and a four-day symposium on Ligeti's work with talks, lecture demonstrations and performances by faculty of the University and other institutions.

I attended the 3/7 keynote lecture by Amy Bauer titled "Read My Desordre: Ligeti Against the Historicists," a pun on the title of Joan Copje's 2015 monograph _Read My Desire: Lacan Against the Historicists_, which attempts to resolve the conflict between two schools of critical theory: Lacanian psychoanalysis and Foucauldian Historicism.

Bauer (and Copje too, although I haven't read "desire") fall into the psychocanalytic camp. But, as Bauer quoted in her introduction, Ligeti once exclaimed that "Lacan is a fraud!" Nonetheless, Bauer is content to use the psychoanalytic method to analyze his work and praises the work of UChicago's Seth Brodsky, within the same tradition.
