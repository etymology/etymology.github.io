(This post is part of a series of imagined conversations. You can find the others [here](/categories/#conversation))

Conversation has been a classic mode of thought for philosophers socrates. Recently I had a great many good ideas whilst in conversation with [^1]


Conversation is a special mode of thinking. In a good conversation mutually exposes mental structures, feeling out the landscape of our interlocutor's mental landscape. A conversation is not an argument, though we may disagree with our interlocutors.

Sometimes, for the fruitfulness of its content or the coincidence of points of view, a converation sticks with me, provoking thoughts and further reflections. Sometimes, these conversations stretch out over weeks, months, years, as they have with my good friend David.

Surely it says something about way that the minds of two conversants collide to create a conversation that ours have often tended to settle on now familiar themes. And it is a credit to David's persistence and earnest belief (and not at all to my obstinate confrontationalism) that these conversations have stretched over more than two years.

In trying to tie together the various strands of our conversation, I realized that there were some trends consistent enough to call arguments, or trains of thought, and that over these many encounters, we had actually made progress, although we raised many problems and paradoxes along the way.

With a mind to capture the spirit of these conversations, I wish to recount a few distinct encounters and then reflect on the connections between them, drawing connections and pulling themes from them.
