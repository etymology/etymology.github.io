When I mentioned to a recent acquaintance that I had been thinking about BWV 988, the so called "Goldberg Variations," he suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's 1970 recording. (You can listen to it [here](https://youtu.be/F9_m4KoTC6w)) My attempts to explain the recording and my reactions to it prompted a number of thoughts.

Richter's performance is neither Gouldian in its individualist anachronism, nor does it clearly follow what we would call today "historically informed" performance (hence, HIP). Although he plays a harpsichord instead of a piano, his instrument does not resemble those available to Bach at the time of composition, and many of his interpretive choice (tempi, rubato, accents) differ significantly from those made by modern (read: HIP) performances. 

A complete etiology and analysis of Richter's style and his relation to the HIP movement, which was to flourish commercially and artistically in the decade following this recording, will have to be left for another time. Rather, I wish to focus on two aspects of the recording which I feel best explain my initial distaste: Richter's instrument and his use of it, and his sense of time, tempo, and meter.

### On affordances

The harpsichord used in the 1970 recording is a large, loud one. I did not bother to find out its make or disposition but I seems to have (in addition to the normal 8' choirs) 16', 4' nasard and buff. As Williams reminds us, Bach's was a region whose "first keyboard-love was the organ, and whose harpsichords were either simply work-horses or elaborate pseudo-organs" and is clear that Richter's instrument falls into the latter category, although its disposition is not comparable to any German keyboard instruments from the period of composition, ca. 1735-40.

Perhaps, though, this instrument suits Richter, whose first training was as an organist, and who uses the dispositional variety of his instrument in great diversity, often changing on the repeats or even with phrases.
