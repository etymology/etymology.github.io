When I mentioned that I'd been thinking about and playing Bach's so called "Goldberg" variations, an recent acquaintance suggested that I listen to Karl Richter's recording, which I did. (You can listen to it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9_m4KoTC6w))

As I considered how to tactfully say that I found the recording strange and lifeless, I got to thinking: what's wrong with Richter anyways? In my musical circles, romantic interpreters of Bach like Richter and Furtwangler are looked down upon as relics of an age lacking in essential knowledge about the context of ancient music.

But this narrative or musicological progress could fall prey to the same narrative of organological progress that argues (as did Johann Buis at a recent CSO pre-concert lecture) that the classical orchestral instruments (itself a shifting category) did not reach their full maturity until the 19th or 20th centuries.

If we are to argue for, say, Schornsheim over Richter or Butt over Furtwangler
