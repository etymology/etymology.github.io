I write as a means to think about and digest the world. My interests include musicology/organology, intellectual history, philosophy and linguistics. 

Recent areas of inquiry include
* Musical performance and composition in the early modern period
* The relationship between ethics and personal identity
* Ethics, sociology and history of suicide
* History/theory of beauty
