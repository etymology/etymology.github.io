<p>Until its fifth and most recent edition of 2013, Diagnostics and Statistics Manual, the American Pschiatric Association’s diagnostic handbook included a “bereavement exception.”</p>

<p>Perhaps this is what Agnes Callard had in mind at the informal seminar she held on 3/2 at a University of Chicago undergraduate dorm. Callard associate professor of philosophy at The University and author “Aspiration: The Agency of Becoming” (2017, OUP).</p>

<p>We should begin with an introduction of the Hybrid Theory of Valuing (hence H). H tries to explain what it means to say things like “I value my friends” or “I value listening to music, and thus go to the symphony.” To further clarify, it distinguishse personal valuing from the belief that something is valuable. We may believe that the going to museums is a valuable activity, but not value it for ourselves: we might never seek it out.</p>

<p>On H, full fledged valuing of a thing A involves three dispositions</p>

<ol>
  <li>Belief that A is valuable (in a general sense)</li>
  <li>Desire for A</li>
  <li>Emotional vulnerability towards A (The nature of this disposition was not made abundantly clear, but it may not matter)</li>
</ol>

<p>The focus of the talk was an argument, presented by Callard, which went rought as follows</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose that we hold the Hybrid Theory of Valuing (hence, H). When we lose something or someone that we value (“value breakdown”), we can no longer fulfill condition 2 of H because we cannot desire what we know to be impossible (i.e. the bringing about of that which was lost). This sort of value is defective, because the object of our value is causing up pain. Thus it is best described as a sort of mental illness. But then we can conclude that a broad class of emotions brought about by loss are metnal illness. Perhaps all negative emotions are mental illness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The talk focused on an arguemnt arising from a theory of what it means to “value” something that led to an ostensibly repugnant conclusion. Callard called the theory the “hybrid theory of valuing.” I present the theory, which Callard asserts is commonly accpeted by those in the field, to the best of my memory.</p>

<p>On the Hybrid Theory, full fledged valuing of a thing A involves three dispositions</p>

<ol>
  <li>Belief that A is value (in a general sense)</li>
  <li>Desire for A</li>
  <li>Emotional vulnerability towards A (The nature of this disposition was not made abundantly clear, but it may not matter)</li>
</ol>

<p>In conflict with this kind of valuing are situations of “value breakdown”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Case 1: My father dies. I still value him, a fact evinced by my grief. But I fail to meet the desire requirement because I cannot desire what is impossible: I cannot desire to bring about his presence.</li>
  <li>Case 2: As a student, I strongly valued having a career in philosophy, but when I realize that there are no jobs in my AOS, I am crushed. My emotional response signals that I have a kind of value for the thing, but like how I cannot desire a dead relative, I cannot desire what I believe to be impossible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Callard then suggested the following exploratory line of argument.</p>

<p>In these cases, valuing is in some way defective, for our valuing of the thing in question leads us to experience mental injury. These kinds of mental injury have all the characterstics of mental illness, but they are caused by normal everyday occurrences. So we are forced to suppose that all negative emotions (or at least a large part of them) are mental illness.</p>

<p>Callard seemed to think that most would be reluctant to accept such a conclusion. I am not. It seems to me that mental illness are matters degree, not of kind. While neurotic or irrational thoughts are the characteristic of mental illnesses, they are present in all minds. We all need some fear, for example fear of being hit by cars when hit when crossing the street, in order to go on living. When these fears are overwhelming and not in accordance with the real threats, perhaps we are deeply afraid of being injured even when sitting at home alone, we call this a mental illness.</p>

<h3 id="is-value-breakdown-defective">Is value-breakdown defective?</h3>

<p>One way in which we can break the aforementioned line of reasoning is to argue that the kind of valuing in Cases 1 and 2 are not full fledged valuing. I believe that this is not necessary. In Case 1, I believe that what we mean when we say that we value</p>
